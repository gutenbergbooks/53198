<p>When the Allens&mdash;Philip, Jimmy, Penny and Marjorie&mdash;opened
their Michigan Lodge as a summer
hotel, they decided to track down the rumor of buried
treasure. Other people, however, had the same idea,
and before the Allens could solve the baffling clues
they discovered, they found themselves in real danger.
How they found the treasure, and how Penny and
Philip found romance with it, make an exciting and
romantic adventure everyone will enjoy.</p>

<h2><span><a name="i" id="i"></a>CHAPTER 1</span><br />
A NEW ADVENTURE</h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">A warm June</span> breeze was blowing in from Lake
Superior. It caught a strand of Penny Allen’s blonde
hair and blew it across her dark blue eyes.</p>

<p>Penny was out in the clearing behind the Lodge
hanging blankets on the line. “Help,” she called to
her brother, Philip, who was working nearby. “Help,
I can’t see what I’m doing, and my arms are full of
blankets.”</p>

<p>Philip, his clear, blue-gray eyes sparkling with
laughter, hurried to the rescue. He extricated Penny
from the mound of blankets she was carrying and
helped her hang them on the line.</p>

<p>As they worked together, fighting the capricious
breeze that threatened every minute to blow the
blankets away, Penny said excitedly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
“I can’t believe it, Phil. We’re practically ready to
open the Lodge for guests!”</p>

<p>“Well, not quite,” Philip said soberly. He was
twenty, a year older than Penny, and usually wore a
rather serious air. This was partly due to his responsibilities
as the head of the Allen family.</p>

<p>Their Uncle John Allen had died suddenly a year
ago leaving the four orphans, Penny, Philip, Jimmy
and Marjorie, to shift for themselves. He had left the
Lodge to Philip and a beautiful yacht, the <em>Penny
Allen</em>, to Penny.</p>

<p>Recently, Philip had decided to turn his inheritance
into a business venture. The lovely house, situated in
the Michigan woods near Lake Superior, would make
an ideal summer hotel. Ever since the first of June
they had all been busy helping to get it ready for
many of their old friends who planned to spend the
summer there.</p>

<p>“Don’t look so serious, Phil,” Penny cried. “We
<em>are</em> just about ready.”</p>

<p>Philip’s eyes, under their straight, dark eyebrows,
were thoughtful. “We’re not even organized yet,
Penny,” he said. “The winter just seemed to go like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
lightning.” A quick smile dispelled his seriousness.
“I guess we spent too much of the holidays enjoying
the winter sports.”</p>

<p>“Pooh,” Penny said impulsively. “We were all together
and we had fun. We deserved that.”</p>

<p>Orphans since thirteen-year-old Marjorie, the
youngest, had been a baby, the Allens had hardly
known one another, for they had all gone to different
schools and summer camps. But in spite of that, they
had managed to maintain a merry and cheerful household.</p>

<p>And now they were all bound and determined to
make a success of their summer hotel. “We’ve got
plenty of time to get organized in,” Penny argued.
She pushed her light brown hair out of her eyes with
one hand and tucked the last clothespin in place with
the other. “Here come Marjorie and Jimmy. You
can organize us all right now.”</p>

<p>“Hi,” Jimmy called, striding toward them. He was
the darkest member of the family, contrasting sharply
with Marjorie.</p>

<p>She was very fair, with light golden hair and light-blue
eyes. Her slight figure and small delicate hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
gave her an almost elfin grace to which was added a
delightfully mischievous quality. “She looks delicate,”
Jimmy often said. “But the kid’s as tough as nails.”</p>

<p>Jimmy’s current aim in life was to reach at least
six feet before he stopped growing. Almost daily the
slender, seventeen-year-old boy insisted that Philip
stand back to back with him in order to determine
whether or not he had finally become the tallest member
of the family.</p>

<p>Judging by the quantities of food he packed away,
Penny felt sure that he would never stop growing.
Moreover, it seemed to her that he was quite tall
enough now. What he needed to do was to gain a
little weight.</p>

<p>“A summer here, spent mostly outdoors,” she said
to Philip, “will do both Marjorie and Jimmy a world
of good. I hope they each gain a few pounds before
they go back to school.”</p>

<p>Marjorie, who had been trailing behind Jimmy,
called out then: “Now that the blankets are airing,
Penny, can’t we go through the stuff in the storage
room?” She broke into a run and arrived by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
clothesline almost out of breath. “I can’t wait to see
what’s in those old trunks.”</p>

<p>“Probably nothing but junk,” Jimmy said. “You
know what Uncle John always called this place.”</p>

<p>When they had first come to the Michigan house
early in the fall they had expected to find a shack
because their Uncle John had always referred to it
as the “Michigan Shack.” But in spite of its name, it
had turned out to be a very pretentious log structure
evidently built for just such a purpose as they were
planning to put it to now.</p>

<p>Allen Lodge was imposing with its wide front and
its two-story porches. The spacious living room was
two stories high with the bedrooms opening off a
balcony which extended around three sides of the
room. The large dining room, kitchen and pantry,
were on the Lake side. There were great fireplaces in
many of the rooms and Philip said that it must have
been planned as a summer hotel or a hunting lodge
because the arrangement was ideal for large numbers
of people.</p>

<p>The interior, with its lovely hand-hewn rafters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
and paneled walls was a delight to the eye, and even
better, it was easy to take care of. Allen Lodge suggested
nothing but comfort. No one knew of its
secret room except the Allens and their newly made
friend.</p>

<p>They had heard when they first came here that
the house was haunted, but it had not taken them long
to discover that the ghost was only Adra Prentice,
a very nice girl whom they had discovered hiding in
the secret room. Adra, who was eighteen years old,
had “haunted” the Allen’s house when she had run
away from her kidnappers. Their adventures and the
way they solved the mystery is told in <cite>Penny Allen
and the Mystery of the Haunted House</cite>. The four
Allens were now ready for a new adventure and they
felt that their own house was the best place to find it.</p>

<p>“Those old trunks aren’t filled with junk,” Marjorie
was saying to Jimmy. “Penny and I looked into
one of them and it’s positively overflowing with fascinating
old dresses that would be wonderful if we
give a masquerade. And there’s an old jewelry box&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Filled to the brim,” Penny finished, smiling, “with
costume jewelry not worth a cent.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
“See?” Jimmy demanded, grinning at Marjorie.
“Junk.” He turned to Phil. “Pat asked me to plant
some beans in his garden behind the cabin the Donahues
are going to occupy. If you don’t need me, I’ll
go do it now.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” Phil said. “It won’t take long.”</p>

<p>Pat Ryan, who had been Uncle John’s guide and
the caretaker of the Lodge, had just married Ann
Mary. He and his new wife had voluntarily taken
over the responsibility of helping the Allens. Philip
and Penny realized they would be lost without the
Ryans in this undertaking. As Philip said, “They’ve
completely spoiled us. I wouldn’t think of doing anything
without first consulting Pat. He seems to know
everything about everything and as luck would have
it, we know next to nothing about anything. Fate
must have brought us together, or better yet, Uncle
John must have had us in mind when he first got Pat
to work for him.”</p>

<p>Penny agreed wholeheartedly with Phil.</p>

<p>“Pat’s orders,” she told Jimmy before he started off
to plant beans, “must always be obeyed.” She pointed
gaily to the blankets that were swaying and billowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
in the sunny June breeze. “See what I’ve done with
our household chattels! To think I might have gone
through life only knowing about readin’, writin’ and
’rithmetic if Ann Mary hadn’t taken me in hand and
shown me how to run a house.”</p>

<p>“Don’t feel so cocky, Sis,” said Jimmy, an impish
grin on his face. “You probably have lots more to
learn. All I can say is, you’d better hurry up and
acquire the missing knowledge before Peter gets
here.”</p>

<p>Penny blushed at the mention of Peter Wyland’s
name. Even though he was an old friend and the
Allens had known him for years, he had just recently
shown his preference for Penny’s company and
Penny was still not used to being teased about it.</p>

<p>Phil shrewdly guessed that Penny had been in love
with Peter ever since last winter. That was when they
had discovered that Peter was a secret service man in
the employ of Mr. Prentice. Phil had not talked to
Penny about Peter even when he noticed that she
seemed to get letters from Wyland quite regularly.
Philip’s mind these days was much preoccupied with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
thoughts of Adra Prentice. He seemed unable to get
her out of his mind, and he found that no matter what
he was doing, his thoughts would always go back to
Adra.</p>

<p>Both Phil and Penny knew that Jimmy and Marjorie
would never stop teasing them about their feelings,
so, contrary to their usual method of discussing
everything among themselves, they had not said
anything about this. Nevertheless, it seemed to be
more or less understood, and although Penny couldn’t
help blushing, she pretended to ignore Jimmy’s teasing
remark.</p>

<p>“Get along with you,” Phil said to his younger
brother. “If you don’t plant those beans soon they’ll
sprout in your pocket.”</p>

<p>Jimmy departed, laughing. “Come on, lazy-bones,”
he called over his shoulder to Marjorie. “I’ll let you
help me for a change. Even <em>you</em> can’t botch up a job
as simple as planting beans.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, no,” Marjorie said with dignity. “I
weeded all day yesterday while you were fishing.”
Marjorie had not missed Penny’s blush, and couldn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
resist a chance for teasing her older sister. “Why are
your cheeks so pink, Penny?” she asked carelessly.</p>

<p>“She’s getting sunburned,” Phil said, quickly coming
to Penny’s rescue. “If you spent more time looking
in the mirror, Marjorie, you’d see that your own nose
is as red as a beet.”</p>

<p>Just then an old Ford drew up in front of the
house. Pat Ryan got out, followed by the new summer
help. Theresa, who was Pat’s sister and lived in
the nearby village, had a smile on her broad Irish
face. The Allens loved her Irish brogue and her tremendous
bulk. Marjorie said she was worth her
weight in gold.</p>

<p>“It’s glad I am to be here working for the Allens,”
she said.</p>

<p>Penny welcomed her and said, “It’s we who are
glad you could come, Theresa, and the rest of you
too. We’d never be able to swing this experiment if
it weren’t for the Ryans and you, and we think you’re
bricks to do this on a co-operative basis, because right
now we don’t know if we’ll make a profit, or lose
money.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
“Don’t you go worrying about a little thing like
that,” answered Theresa, and with a wink at Pat she
added, “Anybody that finds out about Ann Mary’s
cooking will gladly pay double the fee you’re charging,
if Pat isn’t going to be too jealous to let anybody
else taste that good food.”</p>

<p>“Okay with me,” said Pat good-naturedly. “Providing
I get my share.”</p>

<p>Slowly following behind Theresa were two people
the Allens had never met. Penny and Phil shook their
hands as Theresa introduced them.</p>

<p>“This is Mr. and Mrs. Mal Donahue, Ann Mary’s
cousins. Mrs. Donahue was Kathleen Doherty and
we always call her Kitty. It’s a cinch your help will
all be getting along fine together since we’re all Irish
and all related. Seems as though all the Irish are related
to each other, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>This brought forth gales of laughter from Jimmy
who had interrupted his work in the garden to greet
the new arrivals.</p>

<p>“I hope you like your cabin,” he said to the Donahues.
“All of our vegetables are growing right in your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
back yard, so whenever you get hungry all you have
to do is reach out the window and pick some pole
beans.”</p>

<p>They smiled at him while Philip said, “We hope
you will be happy with us, Mal and Kitty.”</p>

<p>Mal Donahue cleared his throat. “We’d like the
job, sir, uh&mdash;er,” and he hesitated. “We were&mdash;ahem&mdash;curious,
you see. We heard the house was haunted
last winter, and some people say there’s hidden treasure
around here. We hope it’s just a plain ordinary
house. Kitty and I don’t like surprises.” This speech
was made with some effort and once again Jimmy
couldn’t control his amusement.</p>

<p>He laughed and slapped Mal on the back. “If
there’s any treasure, old man, you and I will find it
together.” This seemed to reassure Mal.</p>

<p>When Philip and Penny walked toward the Lodge
later, she said, “I think we are lucky, Phil, to get these
young folks. I like their looks, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“I certainly do,” Philip agreed. “And Pat and Ann
Mary will need all the extra help they can get. If
things work out the way we hope they will, we’ll
have to hire more people from the village.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
Penny nodded. “I’m very pleased with Kitty. She
looks like a dear, and she’ll make a nice appearance
waiting on the table.” She sighed. “It’s too bad anyone
as attractive as Ann Mary must stay in the kitchen
most of the time.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about that,” Phil said with a laugh.
“I’m sure all our guests will want to go back and tell
her how good her food is and they’ll get to know her
that way. Besides,” he went on, “she won’t stay in the
kitchen all the time. Even if she’s supposed to do nothing
but cook, you know Ann Mary will pitch in and
help the others whenever she has any spare time.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” Penny said thoughtfully. “And I’m
beginning to see what you mean about our getting organized.
We really should all work according to some
sort of schedule so we won’t be getting in each other’s
way.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” Philip said. “We must have a serious
meeting this evening and assign definite tasks to each
one of us.”</p>

<p>“Right after dinner,” Penny agreed. “Now, before
we go back to work in the house, let’s read the mail
the postman left on the porch a while ago. I&mdash;I,” she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
confided, “I’m sort of hoping I’ll hear from Peter Wyland.
He’s not sure he can take a vacation from his
job until the end of summer.”</p>

<p>“Cheer up, Sis,” Phil said encouragingly. “Maybe
there’ll be a letter from him saying he can come
sooner.”</p>

<p>They hurried up the steps to the porch where a
stack of letters was waiting for them.</p>

<h2><a name="ii" id="ii"></a><span>CHAPTER 2</span><br />
AN ANONYMOUS LETTER</h2>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">The first</span> letter Penny opened was from the Curtises
saying that they would arrive in about a week, the first
weekend in July.</p>

<p>“That is,” Mrs. Curtis wrote, “if it won’t be rushing
you too much, Penny dear.”</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Curtis, whom the Allens fondly called
Grandma and Grandpa Curtis, had been old friends of
Uncle John’s. Their daughter Mary and their son
Charles were the same age as Penny and Philip and
they had spent many summers together in camps.
They were to be the first guests at Allen Lodge and
were planning to stay the entire summer.</p>

<p>When Mr. Curtis had heard about the ideal fishing
his family had difficulty restraining him from coming
up before the Lodge was really open for business.</p>

<p>“The Curtises are always doing something to help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
us,” brightly asserted Penny as she finished the letter
out on the big front porch.</p>

<p>She and Philip looked out on the lawn, a wide,
trimmed space in front of the house, its grass thick, its
masses of shrubbery and groups of beautiful trees
stately, and its flowers just beginning to bloom. Truly,
summer had come to the shores of Lake Superior, and
Phil surveyed the property with great pride.</p>

<p>Watching the expression on his face, Penny said,
“Uncle John certainly had good taste, Phil. You have
every reason to be proud of your inheritance.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” Phil said. “But don’t forget to give
credit where it is due. Jimmy and I have done a good
job of lawn-mowing and tree-trimming, if I do say so
myself.” He stretched his long arms. “That kind of
work is a real muscle builder.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet it is,” Penny said. “And it’s grand to know
that I’ll have plenty of flowers for the dining room
tables and for every bedroom in the Lodge. Pat takes
very good care of the cutting flowers in his old-fashioned
garden. If you and Jimmy take as good care
of the flowering shrubs, the Lodge will be a bower of
blossoms inside and out all summer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span></p>

<p>Marjorie and Jimmy came out on the porch then
with their hands full of more mail that Pat had brought
back when he went into town for Theresa and the
Donahues.</p>

<p>“‘Lo,” said Jimmy. “Help us sort this out. Gobs
came in today after the postman left.”</p>

<p>Jimmy sat down in one of the large, old-fashioned
wicker chairs and Marjorie drew up a little footstool
in front of him.</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” said Philip, “We’ll trust you and Marjorie
to sort it all out and hand it over, won’t we,
Penny?”</p>

<p>“Only too glad to have you do it,” replied Penny,
slumping down in her chair and pretending to relax.
“Only don’t take too long, if anything looks interesting,”
she added.</p>

<p>Jimmy’s answer to that was to toss a flat letter into
her lap, and to follow that closely with another slimmer
one, carefully twirled by its corner to insure its
falling at the proper distance.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t, Jimmy,” protested Marjorie, over
whose head the missives were hurled.</p>

<p>“That will keep her quiet, Marge,” Jimmy announced.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
But Penny was already quiet, not even hearing
Jimmy’s last remark.</p>

<p>“You have the biggest pile, Phil,” Marjorie stated
in a few moments.</p>

<p>The pile in front of Phil was falling over with letters,
papers, advertisements and catalogues. The process
of dividing the mail was soon completed and silence
reigned except for giggles from Marjorie as she read a
long letter from her best friend, Judy Powell. Penny,
deeply engrossed in one of hers, gave a slight exclamation
once, and Philip whistled as he laid aside a long
envelope. But no one stopped to ask questions.</p>

<p>Penny looked at the absorbed group as she finished
her last letter and smiled. Marjorie stopped reading her
letters and looked off into space.</p>

<p>“Read me some of Judy’s letter, Marjorie,” said
Penny.</p>

<p>Marjorie turned with a smile to say that it was such
a good letter and so funny&mdash;“Judy wants to know by
telegram when they can come.”</p>

<p>“She shall, Marjorie,” Philip answered immediately.
“I’m thinking of getting a special telegram blank
printed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
Marjorie looked at Phil to see if he really meant
such an idiotic thing; but as Phil only winked at her,
she merely said, “Crazy!” and turned to Judy’s letter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noi">“Dearest Marjorie:</p>

<p>I think it’s simply tops that we can be together
this summer. I was so afraid my parents would insist
on sending me to camp again. Not that I don’t
like camp, but I know it’s going to be so much more
exciting to do things together, like exploring in the
woods. Will we be allowed to go through the
woods by ourselves? Are there secret cabins, or
wonderful hiding places? Can we sleep out at night?
I’ll bet it’s wonderful swimming in Lake Superior!
Oh, couldn’t you telegraph and let me know right
away when we can come? I have so many questions
to ask, I don’t know where to begin.</p>

<p>My brother Alf says he would rather come to
Michigan than go on the canoe trip in Canada. He
says he always has fun with Jimmy. Maybe the boys
will let us help them build something or do some of
the things with them. Alf says they’ll never take us
fishing because girls talk too much, but maybe we
can convince them that we know how to keep quiet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
I’m so excited that at last we are going to see the
Lodge, and all the Allens and especially you, that’s
all I can write about.</p>

<p>Do Charles Curtis and Peter Wyland both still
like Penny? Does Penny like either one of them?
Maybe I should be minding my own business, but
I guess I am just bubbling over with questions. Cincinnati
is hot as it always is in the summer and we
can’t wait until we get to Michigan. Quick, quick,
quick, send me a telegram. It will be the first one I
ever received.</p>

<p class="mb0">At present I just live in a bathing suit and we
spend almost all day at the pool. I’m glad school is
out. Alf says I’m a nuisance and a question box, and
by now, you probably think the same. I can’t wait
until I see you,</p>

<p class="right mt0 mb0">Forever yours,</p>
<p class="right2 mt0">Judy.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When Marjorie had finished reading Judy’s letter
out loud, Jimmy chuckled. “She’s a riot, that Powell
kid.”</p>

<p>Penny was already scribbling a message on the back
of an envelope. “Here,” she said to Jimmy, “go in to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
the phone in the office and send this telegram to Judy
right away. There’s no reason why the Powells
shouldn’t come the first weekend in July when we expect
the Curtises.”</p>

<p>“Hooray!” Marjorie shouted as Jimmy went in to
send the telegram. At that moment Kitty Donahue
came out on the porch.</p>

<p>“Hi,” Marjorie greeted her. “When do we eat in
this Lodge?”</p>

<p>Kitty came nearer. “I just wanted to ask Miss Penny
about that. We’ve a big fish baking and I wondered if
you would be ready to eat in half an hour.”</p>

<p>“Hooray, food!” shouted Marjorie. “We’re always
ready to eat, Kitty. Are we going to have a conference
tonight to assign various duties, Penny?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we are,” Penny answered. “Kitty, did you
ever help in a summer hotel, or anything like that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, <em>ma’am</em>! And Mal helped the chef at one of the
lake resorts right near here. That is what made Ann
Mary think about sending for us.”</p>

<p>Philip had turned to look at Kathleen while she
talked. “That is very fortunate for us, Mrs. Donahue,”
he said. “We’re going to have a family confab tonight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
to decide what each of us should do and we’d like all
of you to come and help us make decisions.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” Kitty said. “We’ll not need much more
help, only some people from around the village to wait
on table if there is a very large crowd over weekends,
or for some special occasions.” With that bit of advice,
Kitty went back into the house.</p>

<p>Jimmy came out on the porch then and said to Marjorie:
“I told the operator to sign your name to the
telegram. I thought Judy would get a kick out of
that.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” Marjorie said, smiling. “Sometimes you
can be nice, Jimmy.”</p>

<p>He ignored her and started gathering up his mail.
“By the way,” he said to Penny and Phil, “my old
schoolmate, Brook, is coming that weekend, too, if
it’s all right with you.”</p>

<p>“Fine,” Penny and Phil said together.</p>

<p>Jimmy grinned. “Brook wrote that he is going to
bring all of his old clothes. He says he’ll bring one
decent suit, but he hopes he’ll not have to put it on.
I’m right with him there! I think Judy Powell has the
right idea about living in a bathing suit all summer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
Say, Alf Powell, Brook and I will certainly have some
wonderful fun this summer. Maybe we can put up a
shack for us to sleep in.” He went on, pacing up and
down excitedly, “Or part of that old barn. It would
be fun if we could be by ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Calm down, Jimmy,” Phil said. “I don’t think
Alf’s or Brook’s parents will think their sons ought to
be sleeping in a shack if they are paying good money
for rooms, do you?”</p>

<p>Jimmy ran his hands through his short, dark hair.
“Naw, I guess not. But we could bunk out there sometimes,
couldn’t we?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” Penny told him. “It wouldn’t be much
fun if you didn’t rough it every now and then.” She
went on seriously. “I’m counting on you, Jimmy, to
keep an eye on any kids who may come with their
parents. You and Marjorie must help to keep them
amused, too. It will be rather like running a summer
camp, with you two as junior counselors. You’ll have
to supervise games and sports, and maybe, Jimmy,
give some of them swimming lessons.”</p>

<p>“Ha!” Jimmy narrowed his eyes. “The plot thickens.
Looks like I’m going to have to work. But don’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
worry, Penny. Brook, Alf and I will keep the small
fry busy.”</p>

<p>“Grand,” Penny said approvingly. “You’ve taken
a load off my mind, Jimmy. Everyone has simply got
to help me as much as possible if we’re going to see to
it that our guests are kept amused.”</p>

<p>She glanced at Marjorie. “And that means you, too,
imp. Don’t you dare spend all your time with your
chum, Judy.”</p>

<p>“I won’t,” Marjorie promised. “Not unless Jimmy
spends all his time with Alf and Brook.”</p>

<p>Philip glanced at his wrist watch. “Any objections
to you two getting washed up before dinner?” But
he looked at Jimmy as he spoke.</p>

<p>“Not a one,” returned Jimmy with a wide grin. “I
wonder why Phil looked at me,” he continued, still
grinning.</p>

<p>“Because, you’re practically just past the stage when
getting you washed behind the ears was quite a family
problem,” said Marjorie.</p>

<p>“Look who’s talking,” called Jimmy as he disappeared
into the house.</p>

<p>After they had all consumed the delicious baked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
fish which Pat had caught that very day and Ann
Mary had fixed in a delectable fashion, all the Allens
met around the council table. This was the big table
in the living room and here they were soon joined by
the Ryans, Theresa and the Donahues.</p>

<p>Philip then outlined a plan which they all discussed
and finally the duties were assigned to everyone’s satisfaction.
Pat was to continue what he had always done
and be a general overseer of the entire Lodge. He
would make arrangements for fishing parties, get boats
and guides and order lunches to be packed. He would
lock up every night and do many other things.</p>

<p>Ann Mary was in complete charge of the kitchen
and Mal and Kitty were to be her assistants. Kitty
would serve and Mal also had some outdoor duties.
Theresa was to do the cleaning, and Mal and Kitty
were going to pitch in and help with that too.</p>

<p>Marjorie had offered to wait on table and help with
the cooking, but Philip told her that the family would
have their hands full with the entertaining of their
guests. However, all the Allens planned to help out
every place, all of the time, whenever they were free
from their other assigned duties. Jimmy had lettered a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
large sign and hung it on a temporary billboard. It
read:</p>

<p class="center line-spacing2">MEETING OF<br />
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS<br />
OF<br />
ALLEN LODGE</p>

<p>Marjorie now pointed to the sign and said, “I feel
pretty important being a director. Is that why I can
get out of cooking and serving?”</p>

<p>At this remark Phil guffawed and Jimmy and
Penny joined him, much to Marjorie’s chagrin.</p>

<p>“Don’t you kid yourself,” Jimmy said, “Even if
Phil says you’ll have your hands full entertaining
guests, you know you’ll have them twice as full, because
I’m sure we’ll all have to help each other when
our Lodge is running full force.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
Philip, it was decided, was to be the official treasurer.
He would keep the books and have full charge
of all receipts and disbursements.</p>

<p>“That,” Jimmy loftily explained to Marjorie,
“means money coming in and money going out.”
Marjorie sniffed. “Keep your definitions of such
simple words to yourself.”</p>

<p>“Let’s be serious,” Phil said. “All hotels and inns
have a rule that unless their <a name="guests" id="guests"></a><ins title="Original has 'guests’'">guests</ins> deposit their valuables
with them for safekeeping, the management is
not responsible. Isn’t that right, Mr. Donahue?”</p>

<p>Mal nodded.</p>

<p>“Well then,” Phil went on, “I think we ought to
keep our guests’ money and jewelry in the safe in
the secret room. And in order to safeguard the secret,
we ought to make it a rule that none of the guests is
allowed in the secret room.”</p>

<p>“Right,” Jimmy agreed heartily. “If we let everyone
run in and out of there it won’t be a secret very
long. I vote that for the rest of the summer, only Pat
is allowed to&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Phil <em>and</em> Pat,” Penny interrupted. “Phil has to
go in and out to the safe because he’s the treasurer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
“That’s right,” Pat agreed. “I’ll act as his substitute.
Phil may not be available at times when we receive
money which should be put right in the safe or when
we need to take some out to pay bills. I’ll only go into
the secret room during such emergencies.”</p>

<p>“Okay, thanks, Pat,” said Phil. “Then, as of now,
it’s a rule that only you and I press the button that
opens the secret door. Said rule to remain in effect
until the end of the season.”</p>

<p>Everyone agreed, and then it was decided that
Penny was to be the hostess and the housekeeper. Ann
Mary was going to help make out the shopping lists,
while Penny did the actual shopping. Marjorie was to
be the assistant hostess as well as the secretary. Luckily
she had learned how to use a typewriter and would
really be a big help when it came to writing letters.
Jimmy was the director of all sports, and even though
that sounded like an easy job, Penny assured him it
would be more than a full-time one.</p>

<p>Penny, Ann Mary and Kitty decided it would be
wise to make out menus for a week in advance. “That
means,” Penny said,
“<a name="that" id="that"></a><ins title="Original has 'That'">that</ins> right after breakfast tomorrow
morning we had better plan the first week’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
menu. An awful lot of guests are arriving the first
weekend in July.”</p>

<p>She sighed wearily. “I guess everything has been
taken care of except the laundry. We’ll all have our
hands full after this week, so I don’t see what we can
possibly do about that.”</p>

<p>“Got any ideas, Ann Mary?” Philip asked.</p>

<p>Ann Mary thought for a minute. “There’s a new
laundry-mat in the village&mdash;just opened the other day.
If we could find someone who would come out twice
a week, bring in the soiled linen, wash it in one of the
automatic machines, and bring it back damp dry,
Kitty, Theresa and I could handle the ironing.”</p>

<p>“A swell idea,” Pat said. “I’ll ask around in the
village when I go in tomorrow. Anyone, even a mere
man,” he added with a chuckle, “can run one of those
spin-dry slot machines. All we need to do is find
someone with a car who’ll tote the stuff back and
forth for a fair price.”</p>

<p>“I guess that takes care of everything,” Penny said.
“Has anybody thought of anything else?”</p>

<p>Jimmy thought it would be a good idea to buy a
sailboat, but that suggestion was promptly vetoed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
“We are going to try and make money before we
spend it, young man,” said Philip. “But if you and
Alf and Brook Sanders want to fix up one out of what
we have, that’s all right with me.”</p>

<p>“Watch us!” retorted Jimmy and immediately suggested
that a few canoes wouldn’t cost much. But
once again Phil put a damper on his ideas.</p>

<p>At this point Jimmy wanted to know what kind of
a suggestion he could make that would not be vetoed,
and Penny and Phil both chimed in at once with,
“Let’s call it a day.”</p>

<p>“But, before the meeting breaks up,” Philip said
soberly, “I want to make an announcement. I don’t
think it’s really important, but I think you should all
hear it.”</p>

<p>He drew from his pocket the long envelope he had
laid aside earlier when they had been out on the porch
reading their mail. “I got an anonymous letter today,”
he said, “and at first I thought I wouldn’t bother you
with it. Writers of anonymous letters are usually
either cowards or cranks. However,” he continued,
“after thinking it over, I’ve decided I have no right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
to keep from you the fact that we have been threatened.”</p>

<p>“Threatened?” Penny repeated. “But, Phil, who&mdash;?”</p>

<p>For answer, Phil opened the envelope and took out
a long sheet of dirty paper which he laid on the council
table.</p>

<p>Everyone crowded around him to read the ugly
scribbled words:</p>

<div class="block-centre">
<div class="block">
MR. PHILIP ALLEN: IF YOU<br />
KNOW WHAT’S GOOD FOR YOU<br />
AND YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS,<br />

<h2><a name="iii" id="iii"></a><span>CHAPTER 3</span><br />
THE ABANDONED WELL</h2>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Ann Mary</span> was the first to speak. “Well, I never,”
she gasped. “Who could have written such an evil
thing, Pat?”</p>

<p>Pat shook his head. “A crank, of course.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I think,” Phil agreed. “Someone who
read the newspaper stories about Adra Prentice’s kidnaping.
Anonymous letters from people who aren’t
quite right mentally generally follow any kind of
publicity.”</p>

<p>“But,” Marjorie objected, “all of that happened
last year.”</p>

<p>“It makes no difference,” Jimmy told her. “People
use newspapers for lots of things besides keeping up
with the news. They wrap china in newspapers, line
shelves and drawers with ’em, for instance. Whoever
wrote that dopey letter may have come across an account
of Adra’s kidnaping just the other day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
Penny nodded. “Let’s tear the ugly thing up and
throw it away. Whoever wrote it probably won’t ever
bother us again.”</p>

<p>“Right.” Jimmy tore the dirty sheet of paper to
shreds and tossed them into the fireplace. Phil set a
match to them and they all watched the scraps burn
away to ashes.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s that,” Penny said. “As if anyone
could scare us Allens away from the Lodge!”</p>

<p>Then the meeting did break up, and four very tired,
but not at all frightened Allens, went upstairs to bed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next morning Jimmy’s first job was to overhaul
the old bus and the Bronc. The Bronc was an
old station wagon that had seen better days. It had
served the Allens well, but right now it sputtered and
rattled and wheezed. The Bus was a small truck and
was used for a multitude of things. It hauled wood
from the woods to the woodbin, it carted supplies
from the town to the Lodge and Philip planned to
use it for taking people on camping trips during the
summer. Jimmy’s favorite pastime was tinkering with
cars, and he seemed to know the intricate mechanics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
of the two old vehicles better than any trained mechanic.</p>

<p>While Jimmy was tinkering with the motors, Phil
and Mal combed the nearby woods for timber. Some
of it would be cut up into logs which would blaze
merrily in the huge fireplaces on cool evenings. The
rest of it, Phil planned to give Jimmy for his shack.
Jimmy had picked a spot on the lake shore where he
and the other boys could build a fire if they wanted.
He also planned to build a little dock and rent a few
rowboats. This was to be the bachelor’s retreat. The
site was in a bit of a bay with some large rocks along
the shore line that would make the dock construction
simpler. Among the trees a little way back, there was
a fairly open place where the shack could stand.
When Phil and Mal had gathered quite a pile of wood,
they called Jimmy down to view the spot.</p>

<p>“Now, all you have to do, Jimmy, is to go to it,”
said Philip.</p>

<p>“I can’t wait until the other boys arrive to get
started,” he answered. “I’m going to start preparing
the logs and lay the floor. Won’t this be ideal?”</p>

<p>In the meantime, Marjorie began her secretarial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
duties by sorting mail and answering as many of the
letters as she could, while Penny went into the village
to shop in order to stock up on staples and to make
arrangements for her weekly orders.</p>

<p>One afternoon Jimmy, Phil and Mal decided to
have a look at the long old shed in the back yard
which they thought might be fixed up to house the
cars of their summer guests. The old shed had been
there all the time, of course, but somehow they had
kept putting off the time when they would examine
it. There had been so many things to do when they
first came, they had not even opened all the rooms
in the house until they had decided to turn it into a
summer hotel.</p>

<p>Now the guest rooms must be cleaned and aired.
Penny and Marjorie were busy from morning to
night helping Theresa and Ann Mary dust and make
beds.</p>

<p>“This is so boring,” Marjorie complained. “The
only room I’m interested in is the old storage room,
Penny. When are we ever going to go through those
old trunks?”</p>

<p>“We’ve had a look at the contents of one of them,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
Penny pointed out patiently. “And we found that it
contained nothing but some very old-fashioned
clothes and a few worthless, though pretty trinkets.
Wait till we have more time, honey. Then you may
rummage around in there to your heart’s content.”</p>

<p>“I can’t understand your lack of curiosity,” Marjorie
moaned. “I can’t sleep nights thinking about
what might be in the trunk we didn’t open.”</p>

<p>Penny laughed. “I guess we’ve had too much indoor
work for one day. Let’s join the boys down at
the shed.”</p>

<p>“Goody, goody,” Marjorie cried, flinging down
her dust cloth. “There’s bound to be something more
exciting than cobwebs out there.”</p>

<p>At last they were hurrying down the concrete
walk, past the Donahues’ small cabin behind the
Lodge. They caught up with Mal and the boys on the
old graveled drive, overgrown with weeds. This drive
led among bushes and trees and looked like an old
horse trail, but it was wide enough for a car to travel
over it with care.</p>

<p>Jimmy took one good look at all the weeds and
said, “I don’t think this is such a good idea, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
since I know I’ll be elected a committee of one to cut
down all these weeds.”</p>

<p>“Why, how did you guess it, young man! You are
getting keen,” laughed Penny. “But this really does
look like a big job, and I’m sure Phil and Mal will
lend a hand, too.” Jimmy looked relieved at this suggestion
and here they were at the shed.</p>

<p>“Pat says that even your Uncle John never made
use of this shed for anything, and that it must have
been a sort of stable back in the old days,” explained
Mal. “See, one of the side walls is pretty badly broken
up, but the roof has been patched and the framework
seems strong. There are a pile of boards and some
poles behind this shed. Looks as though somebody
once had the idea of repairing it. That wood back
there is well seasoned and with the help of the repair
man from the village we could get it fixed up this
week.”</p>

<p>Penny took hold of one of the supports, to which
a few boards were clinging loosely.</p>

<p>“Be careful how you lean against that,” Philip
cautioned her. “That’s the broken wall and we don’t
want you to fall through it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
But just as he finished saying it Penny gasped and
slipped out of sight. For a minute the others stood
there with their mouths open, then Phil and Jimmy
quickly went into action. Mal poked his hand through
the wall where Penny seemed to have disappeared
and Marjorie called, “Penny, Penny, answer&mdash;are you
hurt?”</p>

<p>Phil and Jimmy ran to the outside of the broken
wall but there was nothing there but the old pile of
lumber Mal had mentioned. They called Penny, and
then there was a muffled sound that seemed to come
from the very wall itself.</p>

<p>Phil climbed right up on top of the pile of lumber
and reached over as far as he could toward the wall
when he noticed a sunken place between the wall and
the lumber. It looked like an old well and it was partly
covered. He called to Penny and this time he heard
her answer. As quickly as they could, they all started
to move enough of the lumber so that they could get
closer to the old well. Now they were sure Penny had
fallen into it, and Marjorie ran back to the house as
fast as her feet could carry her to get a strong rope
and more help.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
It seemed like hours, but it was only a few minutes
before Phil and Jimmy were able to lean over the well
and start calling down to Penny.</p>

<p>She answered them this time and they heard her
say quite clearly: “What happened?”</p>

<p>“Whew!” Jimmy gasped, clutching his forehead
with relief. “You fell down an old well.”</p>

<p>“Are you all right, Penny?” Philip asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“I guess so,” Penny called back. “But it’s so dark
I can’t see anything.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry,” Phil said in a reassuring voice.
“We’ll have you out in no time.”</p>

<p>Marjorie arrived then with Pat who had brought
along a long rope. Marjorie was very near to tears.</p>

<p>“Don’t let Penny know you’re frightened,” Phil
cautioned her. “Keep calling down to her in a cheerful
voice to keep her courage up.”</p>

<p>Pat tied a big loop on the end of the rope, then Mal
lowered it into the well, and Phil called down instructions
to Penny. Finally the rope reached her, and she
put the looped end around her waist and held on to it
as tightly as she could with both hands, while the men
pulled her up. When, after what seemed an interminably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
long time, Penny’s head appeared, Marjorie
burst into tears.</p>

<p>Tenderly they lifted Penny out, and she immediately
assured everyone that aside from being bruised
and shaky, she didn’t think she had any broken bones
or other injuries. Ann Mary and Theresa and Kathleen
had arrived on the scene with water and bandages,
all of which were scorned by Penny who said,</p>

<p>“I did a foolish thing and I deserved what I got, but
now that I know I’m all right you can all just forget
about me. If you keep on making such a fuss I’ll feel
like an idiot.”</p>

<p>Of course they all ignored her pleadings and made
her sit right down for a few minutes while Ann Mary
wiped her face with a cloth dipped in cold water.
Then she examined Penny carefully to make sure that
she could move her arms and legs without pain. The
only real damage seemed to be to her appearance
which was quite ludicrous. Now that they knew she
was safe they had a good laugh about it. Penny’s face
and hands and hair were covered with cobwebs, her
dress was ripped and her shoes were sopping wet.
When Phil asked her if there was any water in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
well she said she thought she had stood in water and,
of course, her wet shoes showed that she had. Then
everybody went back to the house, and Penny took
a hot bath which Ann Mary said would serve to
relieve some of the aches and pains she was bound to
develop later from such a fall.</p>

<p>Phil and Jimmy were all set to go back and examine
the well to see if it was still in good working
condition, and if they could find the water source
and perhaps get the well into good order. When they
saw Penny looking her fresh, well-groomed self
again, they went back, accompanied by Pat and Mal.</p>

<p>“It beats me,” Pat said. “I never knew there was a
well of any kind on this property.”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard rumors,” Mal said. “There’s always
been a lot of talk in the village about buried treasure
in the bottom of an old dried-up well around here.”</p>

<p>“I know,” Pat said, “and from time to time when
the house was empty, people who had no business
trespassing, came here and tried to find that well. Had
a lot of trouble with prowlers,” he told Phil. “Your
Uncle John did. But nobody ever found a well.” He
stopped and stared at the hole. “Well, now, here it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
is. And now I wouldn’t be surprised at anything. I’ve
lived around here all my life and never believed there
was a well here. I think we should caution everybody
to try and keep this a secret so we won’t have any
prowlers coming around, and we should get busy and
try to dig up that old well to see if there really is any
treasure there.”</p>

<p>“My gosh!” said Jimmy. “Do you really think
there’s treasure there? What kind of treasure is it
supposed to be, Pat? Were there ever pirates around
here? Won’t Alf and Brook nearly die with excitement
when they hear about this!”</p>

<p>Phil smiled. “I’m afraid we can’t let you say anything
to them, or anybody else, until we investigate
this thoroughly and see if there is any foundation to
the rumor. I agree with Pat, since we don’t need the
well for water, I think we should dig it up at once
and solve this mystery of buried treasure.”</p>

<p>Jimmy was all for going right back for picks and
shovels, so Phil let him go. Phil’s curiosity was aroused
and he could understand Jimmy’s enthusiasm. But
Phil felt quite sure that they were not on the trail
of buried treasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
“The Lodge was supposed to be haunted,” he said
to Mal, “and we proved it wasn’t. Now we’re about
to prove that there’s nothing of any value at the bottom
of this old well.”</p>

<p>Jimmy came running back then with both hands
full of an assortment of picks, shovels and garden
spades. They found that it was exceedingly slow work
since they first had to move the pile of old lumber
and debris that surrounded the old well. When they
finally started digging they found the stones that
formed the well were impossible to move. Pat guessed
that the old well had been there a hundred years or
longer. Jimmy suggested that they use dynamite.</p>

<p>After two hours of concentrated labor Phil commented,
“I don’t think even buried treasure is worth
all this effort.”</p>

<p>But Jimmy, who was obviously in high spirits over
this adventure, contradicted Phil with, “Of course it’s
worth it, Phil, you wait and see what we find.”</p>

<p>Pat shrugged. “I’m not thinking you should set
your heart on finding anything, my lad, because there
probably won’t be any treasure here, any more than
the house was haunted last year.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
“Don’t say that, Pat,” countered Jimmy, “I’m not
used to working like this without any compensation.”</p>

<p>“Not much,” said Phil. “But all kidding aside,
Jimmy, I think Pat is right. However, we’re going to
finish this job, if for no other reason than to keep
anybody else from falling into it. The rope we lowered
to Penny went down about thirty feet and I
would guess that we have dug around the outside of
this old well about ten feet deep. Is that right, Pat?”</p>

<p>Pat nodded. “Yes, that’s about right, and I think
if we get out here bright and early tomorrow morning,
maybe we can finish the job before night.”</p>

<p>Very reluctantly, Jimmy joined the rest as they
returned to the house to tell Penny and Marjorie of
their progress.</p>

<h2><a name="iv" id="iv"></a><span>CHAPTER 4</span><br />
A NIGHT PROWLER</h2>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">That evening</span> they all decided to have a picnic style
supper in front of the fireplace in the living room.</p>

<p>“I’m beginning to feel my bruises,” Penny said
cheerfully. “But I’m not going to let a few aches and
pains bother me. I was very lucky to get off without
broken bones or sprains.”</p>

<p>“You certainly were,” Jimmy said. “And let me
tell you, Sis, I thought I’d go nuts until we finally
heard your voice.”</p>

<p>“Me, too,” Marjorie chimed in. “Gosh, Penny, it
was just about the most awful few minutes of my
life!”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s not talk about it any more,” Penny
said. “The subject I want to discuss is the bottom of
the well. I can’t really&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Gee,” Jimmy interrupted, “wouldn’t it be neat if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
we get to the bottom of the well and find pieces of
gold. We’ll be on easy street the rest of our lives.” He
added, more to himself than the others, “The first
thing I’ll do is get a sailboat. I’ve found out already
that I don’t know enough about naval architecture
to build one.”</p>

<p>“Ha, you don’t get on easy street that easily,” said
Penny. “Besides, I don’t remember feeling anything
beneath my feet but slime, and if all you want is a
sailboat, you’d better work for it!”</p>

<p>“I like that!” exclaimed Jimmy. “And what do you
call digging away at that well? If that isn’t work, I’d
like to know what you’d call it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s work all right,” Penny said with a laugh.
“But I think it’s work without any purpose.”</p>

<p>“So do I, in a way,” Phil said. “But the kids will
never be happy until we get to the bottom and prove
that there isn’t any treasure buried there.”</p>

<p>“You just wait until tomorrow,” Marjorie said stubbornly.
“When we come running up to you, Penny,
with our hands dripping with pieces of eight, then
you and Phil will eat those words.” She raised her
voice. “I know there’s something valuable hidden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
around here, and I, for one, am never going to give
up until I’ve gone over every inch of the place with
a fine-tooth comb!”</p>

<p>“You don’t have to shout about it,” Jimmy said.
“If there is something valuable around here, let’s not
encourage every Tom, Dick and Harry in the village
to come out and try to find it first. Although,” he
went on in a more sympathetic tone of voice, “I know
how you feel, Marjorie. When Alf and Brook get
here, and we haven’t found any gold by then, they’ll
want to dig up the whole place, too.”</p>

<p>“Dig, if you must,” Penny said, “but spare Pat’s
flower beds. I&mdash;” She stopped suddenly, her finger to
her lips. “Sh-h.” She touched Phil’s arm lightly and
pointed to the window, whispering, “Someone’s out
there and I’m afraid he’s heard every word we said.”</p>

<p>They all <a name="stared" id="stared"></a><ins title="Original has 'started'">stared</ins> silently out through the vine-covered
lattice that partially screened the court from
view. The moon was shining brightly, and then from
the shrubbery a shadow moved and melted into a little
clump of low spruces. In another second they saw the
figure of a man slip around the corner of the wing
to disappear again in the shadows of another trellis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span></p>

<p>It was a warm evening, and all of the doors and
windows were wide open. The man might try to get
into the house. Penny started to rise.</p>

<p>But Phil, with his hand on her arm, shook his head
and whispered: “All of you stay right here. I don’t
want him to know that we’ve seen him.” Swiftly he
tiptoed across the room to take his pistol from the
cabinet.</p>

<p>Penny remembered with relief that Phil always
kept his gun loaded. Just then she saw Mal run into
the court. He had obviously seen the prowler from
the kitchen window. Before Penny could shout a
warning, the man darted from the shadows and flung
himself on Mal’s back, one arm around his throat.</p>

<p>At almost the same moment Phil leaped through the
window and fired his gun into the air. As the shot
rang out, Penny closed her eyes. Opening them immediately,
she saw Phil running out of the court,
with Mal close at his heels, in pursuit of the prowler.
Jimmy was just about to jump through the window
to join in the chase, but Penny held him back.</p>

<p>“Stay here with us, Jimmy,” she said. “Phil and
Mal can cope with that eavesdropper.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
Marjorie, who had for once been speechless, found
her voice then. “Oh, yes, Jimmy,” she begged. “Stay
here with us. He might come back, and we haven’t
got a gun.”</p>

<p>Jimmy looked disappointed, but he knew he could
help Phil best by staying with the girls. “Ah, that guy
isn’t going to come back,” he said. He stared gloomily
out of the window as Pat ran across the court to
join the others.</p>

<p>By this time, Kitty and Ann Mary had appeared,
wide-eyed and frightened. “Oh, oh,” Kitty cried. “I
just know my Mal is going to get shot.”</p>

<p>Another shot rang out. Penny’s heart sank. Had
the prowler fired the second shot? Somehow she managed
to disguise her fears and said in a reassuring voice
to Kitty:</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, dear. Phil and Pat know how to
handle their guns.”</p>

<p>“They sure do,” Ann Mary said bravely although
Penny could see that she was almost as terrified as
her cousin. “My Pat won’t let anything happen to
your Mal.”</p>

<p>Theresa came in from the hall then, rubbing her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
eyes bewilderedly. “I was asleep,” she said. “Did I
hear a shot or did I dream it?”</p>

<p>She looked so confused that everyone laughed, and
the tension was eased. “You heard two shots,” Jimmy
told her. “I guess the first one woke you up.”</p>

<p>While he was explaining what had happened, they
heard footsteps on the graveled walk, and in another
moment, they could see Phil, Pat and Mal slowly
approaching the house. Everyone ran out to meet
them.</p>

<p>“He got away,” Phil said ruefully.</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t we notify the police?” Penny asked.</p>

<p>Phil shrugged. “Probably only a tramp. I fired in
the air to frighten him when he jumped on Mal.”</p>

<p>“But you fired a second time,” Marjorie said excitedly.
“We were terrified for fear one of you had
been hurt.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” Jimmy said. “Say, Phil, how about
giving us a play by play description of what happened.
I missed all the fun, remember?”</p>

<p>Phil frowned. “We want to look around some
more. We just came back to be sure the rest of you
were okay.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
“We’re perfectly all right,” Penny said. “Go ahead
with your search.” She smiled. “As long as Jimmy
stays with us we’re perfectly safe.”</p>

<p>“I want to know what happened,” Jimmy complained.
“Give, Phil.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Phil said patiently, “from the minute that
man disappeared into the shrubbery, he slipped from
one tree to another like an Indian, then doubled
around toward the lake.”</p>

<p>“It certainly sounds as though he knows his way
around here,” Marjorie put in.</p>

<p>Phil nodded. “Pat fired the second shot when we
saw him trying to get away in one of our boats. Although
Pat fired into the air, it scared the living daylights
out of him, I guess. He jumped from the boat
and made for the woods below us.” Phil grinned. “I’ll
bet he’s still running. He may think we’re mighty
poor shots, but at least he knows we’re armed. I doubt
if he ever comes back on our property again.”</p>

<p>“But who could it have been?” Penny asked. “A
tramp wouldn’t know his way around our grounds.”</p>

<p>“If anyone should ask me,” Pat said, “I’d say it
was one of those crazy villagers after the so-called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
buried treasure. I’ll bet the news is all over town already
that we found the old well near the shed.”</p>

<p>“But,” Jimmy objected. “Nobody could have
heard about it so soon.”</p>

<p>“A lot of people could have,” Mal pointed out.
“There were several delivery boys out here during
the excitement when Miss Penny fell into the well.”</p>

<p>Ann Mary nodded. “We were all so worried about
Penny we didn’t pay any attention to them. When
Marjorie came running into the kitchen to tell us
about the accident, I dashed out of the house so fast
I almost knocked down one boy who biked out here
with some groceries.”</p>

<p>Pat shook his head gravely. “That rumor about
buried treasure is going to cause us a lot of trouble.
We don’t want the place cluttered up with night
prowlers this summer.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go have a look at the shed,” Jimmy said
eagerly. “Maybe the guy was down there snooping
around and sneaked up to the house to make sure we
were all inside.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Phil said. “But you have to stay with
the girls.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
“Oh, no, he doesn’t,” Marjorie said pertly. “The
girls are going, too.”</p>

<p>“We can’t all leave,” Penny said wisely. “After all,
he might have been a burglar. We would be playing
right into his hands if we left the house deserted with
all the doors and windows open.” She glanced around
at the shadows with a little shiver. “Suppose he doubled
back and is watching us right now, waiting to
see what we’ll do?”</p>

<p>Marjorie moved a little closer to Penny. “Oh, isn’t
it thrilling?” she cried. “I wouldn’t be at all afraid to
stay here and guard the house if I had a gun.”</p>

<p>“Not much you wouldn’t,” Jimmy jeered.</p>

<p>“I for one,” Kitty said, “have no intention of going
down to that shed. I’m going into the house and Mal
is going with me and we’re going to lock ourselves
in.”</p>

<p>“Fine,” Jimmy said. “That solves the problem. Phil
can leave his gun with Mal just in case.”</p>

<p>“Okay,” Mal agreed and stuck Phil’s little pistol
into his pocket. After the Donahues had gone into
the house the others headed for the shed.</p>

<p>Jimmy had brought a flashlight with him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
when they got inside the shed he flashed it all around.
Just as they were about to leave, he shouted, “Look!”
and pointed to a spot near the broken wall where
Penny had fallen through earlier that day.</p>

<p>The floor of the shed had been opened and plainly
showing in the earth under it was a footprint. “Someone
has been here since we left,” Jimmy cried excitedly.
“That footprint was made by a man wearing
a shoe with a rubber sole. And we were all wearing
sneakers.”</p>

<p>“You’re right,” Phil said soberly. “But the man
who made that footprint might not have been our
prowler. It could have been left by one of the delivery
boys whose curiosity was aroused when he heard
about Penny’s accident.”</p>

<p>Penny nodded. “One of them might have biked
back out while we were having supper just to have a
look. Kids are like that.”</p>

<p>“But,” Jimmy argued, “they don’t have such big
feet.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, they do,” Marjorie said with a giggle.
“Take a look at what’s on the end of your own
ankles.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
“Maybe the prowler was just a curious kid,” Penny
said suddenly. “Have you thought of that, Phil?”</p>

<p>Philip thought for a minute. “He had awfully broad
shoulders, and I don’t think a kid would have jumped
on Mal.” He shrugged. “But I really think whoever
it was won’t come back.” He put the floor boards
back in place. “If he does, he won’t do any digging for
buried treasure at this spot. Jimmy, go and get the
old Bus and park it right here.”</p>

<p>Jimmy grinned with delight. “Right. And if our
curious friend comes back to search, he’ll have to
move the Bus. And, unless he’s a Samson he’ll have
to start her up, and, when this thing starts running,
he’ll realize that he’s set off the loudest fire alarm in
Michigan.” He ran off to get the Bus.</p>

<p>“If we don’t find any treasure when we dig up the
well,” Marjorie said, “let’s dig under the floor here.”</p>

<p>“Definitely no,” Phil told her firmly. “We’ll dig
up the well and let it be known far and wide that we
found nothing. That should put a stop to all the silly
rumors.”</p>

<p>Pat nodded approvingly. “And night prowlers.”</p>

<p>When they returned to the house they found that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
Kitty and Mal had sandwiches and a large pot of hot
cocoa waiting for them.</p>

<p>“I think you men should take turns keeping watch
tonight,” Kitty said nervously. “And please, can’t we
sleep in the house tonight instead of in the cabin?”</p>

<p>“Of course, you can,” Phil said. “And perhaps it
isn’t a bad idea for us to take turns keeping an eye
on the place.” He smiled reassuringly. “For the rest
of tonight anyway.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take one shift,” Marjorie said, suppressing a
yawn. “I won’t sleep a wink anyway.”</p>

<p>But she did, the minute her head touched the pillow,
and when she awoke in the morning was very
disappointed to hear that the night had been uneventful.</p>

<p>“At least I didn’t miss anything,” she said as they
hurriedly ate breakfast on the sunny porch. “Now,
to find the buried treasure!”</p>

<p>But the whole day proved to be a tremendous disappointment.
They finally dug all the way down to
the bottom of the well and found absolutely nothing
but mud. And the source of the spring had evidently
gone dry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
“All that labor for nothing,” Pat said in a very
disgruntled voice. “A wasted day.”</p>

<p>Everyone had pitched in and helped at various intervals,
although Jimmy and Marjorie were the only
ones who never gave up hope of finding gold pieces
deep in the mud.</p>

<p>Wearily the men filled up the huge hole, and the
rest of the week was spent in what Ann Mary called
“fruitful labor.” The shed was converted into quite
a presentable garage, and at last even Phil admitted
that they were practically ready to open the Lodge
for business. They were all so busy with final preparations
they dismissed the night prowler from their
minds.</p>

<p>Only Jimmy and Marjorie remained convinced that
there was treasure buried on the grounds.</p>

<p>“What about the laundry situation?” Phil asked
Penny the night before the first guests were expected.
“Have you been able to cope with that?”</p>

<p>“I certainly have,” Penny told him proudly. “Several
days ago a very pleasant-looking man who looks
strong enough to carry any amount of damp linen,
drove out to ask for the job. He’d heard in the village<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
that we wanted someone to tote a huge bundle into
the laundry-mat twice a week, and came right out
without even waiting to telephone for an appointment
with me.”</p>

<p>Phil looked puzzled. “I sort of took it for granted
that you’d give the job to a woman.”</p>

<p>“I planned to,” Penny said, “in spite of what Pat
said about anybody being able to work those automatic
machines. But there just aren’t any women in
the village who drive their own cars and who are free
to help us out.”</p>

<p>“I suppose not,” Phil said.</p>

<p>“This man, a Mr. Taggart,” Penny went on, “recently
moved to town for the summer and needs work
badly. He offered to handle our laundry for us at a
flat rate of only fifteen dollars a week.”</p>

<p>Phil whistled. “Say, that <em>is</em> cheap!” He added teasingly:
“Maybe he’ll take the first batch in and never
come back!”</p>

<p>Penny laughed. “He’s already taken in one big
bundle of sheets and pillow cases and, according to
Ann Mary, brought them back snowy white. She’s
terribly pleased. I had no idea we could get anyone
to do it so cheaply. When the place is filled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
guests he’ll probably demand more money, but let’s
not object. Kitty says the laundry problem in all summer
hotels is usually the hardest one to solve.”</p>

<p>Phil nodded. “If the place really fills up, we’ll not
only have to raise Taggart’s pay, but we’ll have to
get some people from the village to come out by the
day and do the ironing.”</p>

<p>“I’ve thought of that,” Penny said. “The same girls
who are going to help wait on the tables when we
really get going are going to do some ironing between
meals.”</p>

<p>“You think of everything,” Phil said approvingly.
“I’m proud of you, Sis.”</p>

<p>Penny sighed. “You shouldn’t be. I couldn’t do a
thing without the advice of Ann Mary and Theresa
and Kitty. And, frankly, Phil, I’m getting cold feet
at the last minute. What if the whole project is a
flop?”</p>

<p>“It won’t be,” Phil said reassuringly. “You’re just
tired and getting a case of stage fright.” He tucked
her hand through his arm and led her toward the
stairs. “After a good night’s sleep you’ll be your old
irrepressible self again. Full of vim, vigor and vitality!”</p>

ANOTHER THREAT</h2>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Rat-tat-tat</span> on the door.</p>

<p>“Who can that be?” Penny demanded. “We’ve
simply got to get these clean curtains up before the
first guests arrive.”</p>

<p>Phil, who was helping her, said from the top of the
stepladder, “Probably your laundry man, Mr. Taggart.
Ann Mary or Marjorie can take care of it.” He
climbed down the ladder. “Now what?”</p>

<p>“Draperies,” Penny said. “I’ve already put in the
pin hooks so it won’t take long.”</p>

<p>Rat-tat-tat again.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear,” she moaned. “Marjorie and Ann Mary
are probably out in back and can’t hear. Everyone
else is in the village. That’s someone at the front door
so it couldn’t be Mr. Taggart. He always parks his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
car by the Donahues’ cabin. I’d better run down and
see who’s knocking.”</p>

<p>Phil moved his ladder to the window where the
draperies were to be hung. “Wait a minute,” he said.
“Just hand me up those things and then go.” He
stared out of the window as he climbed up. “Say,
that must be your laundry man’s car out there by the
Donahues’ cabin now. Pretty classy, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It certainly is,” Penny agreed hurriedly. She gave
him the draperies and ran down the stairs from the
balcony. At the bottom she stopped. Someone was
rummaging around in the storeroom in the back of
the house.</p>

<p>“Marjorie,” she called, rather crossly. “What are
you doing in there? This is no time to explore! And
didn’t you hear someone knocking on the front
door?” She hurried down the hall muttering to herself:
“With all I have to do, it seems to me that child
could at least stop looking for hidden treasure long
enough to answer the front door!”</p>

<p>But, when she opened the door, Penny’s good nature
was immediately restored. For there stood Judy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
and Alf Powell with Mr. and Mrs. Powell right behind
them.</p>

<p>Their first guests had arrived!</p>

<p>Penny tried to hug everyone at once as she talked
excitedly:</p>

<p>“Why, Alf! You’ve grown like a beanstalk. Jimmy
will be comparing measurements with you in no time.
And Judy, you haven’t changed a bit. My, won’t
you and Marjorie have a million things to talk about.
You can’t imagine, Mr. and Mrs. Powell, how pleased
we were that you could come. This isn’t going to be
like a resort at all. We’re going to be surrounded by
all our old friends. Isn’t this fine! Come right in. How
did you get here? Have you a car to put away?”
Penny peered around but could not see a car any
place.</p>

<p>“No, Penny,” said Mr. Powell. “We decided to
take a plane. Alf, as you probably know, has flown
a few times, but Judy had never been up.”</p>

<p>“We flew to the closest airport,” Mrs. Powell
added, “and took a bus from there to the village. We
left our luggage in the village and walked out. It’s
such a beautiful day. You won’t mind sending your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
truck down for our bags, will you? A nice man in
the village told us you had one.”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” said Marjorie, who suddenly appeared
behind Penny in the hall. “I’d drive it myself
if only my mean old brothers and sister would let
me!” She laughed mischievously.</p>

<p>“Imp!” Penny cried, pushing her straight into
Judy’s arms.</p>

<p>As the two girls hugged each other ecstatically,
Mrs. Powell said to Penny, “This is certainly a lovely
spot. Even your description didn’t do it justice. I
know we’re all going to have a wonderful summer.”</p>

<p>“We saw the lake as we flew over,” Mr. Powell
said enthusiastically, “and it looks large enough to
hold a mighty lot of fish.”</p>

<p>“There’s enough fish there to feed an army,”
chimed in Jimmy as he came running in from the
driveway where he had parked the Bronc. “Alf and
I are going to catch our share.”</p>

<p>Phil came down the stairs from the balcony and
greeted everyone cordially. “You couldn’t have arrived
at a better time,” he told his guests. “If Marjorie
had had to wait one more hour for Judy, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
would have worn a path from the back door to the
front. Ever since dawn she’s been watching for your
car.”</p>

<p>“And yet,” Penny said with a laugh, “when they
did arrive, she didn’t hear them knocking on the
door.”</p>

<p>“I was busy,” Marjorie informed her sister airily.
“Out in the Donahues’ cabin helping Ann Mary get
their laundry together for Mr. Taggart.”</p>

<p>Penny said nothing, but she made a mental note to
scold Marjorie later in private. Marjorie had not been
helping Ann Mary; Penny had heard her rummaging
in the old storage room!</p>

<p>“There’s something a lot better than fish around
here,” Jimmy was saying in an undertone to Alf.</p>

<p>“I’ll say there is,” Marjorie told Judy.</p>

<p>Penny smiled. She could see that the four of them
were already scheming and laying plans to dig up
the entire place in search of buried treasure.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll forget about Marjorie’s little white lie,”
Penny decided. “She didn’t mean any harm, and I
know she’s been dying to poke around in those old
trunks for ages.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span></p>

<p>Jimmy took Alf to his room and Marjorie took
Judy to hers. Philip and Penny escorted Mr. and Mrs.
Powell to the big airy room which had been reserved
for them.</p>

<p>“Oh, Judy, isn’t it wo-o-o-onderful that you are
here,” Marjorie said with a sigh of happiness. “We
haven’t got everything quite arranged yet, so maybe,
just for tonight, you and I can share a room. We’ll
stay up late and talk, and raid the icebox. We have
the most wonderful things to eat in it.”</p>

<p>At this point they had to hug each other and dance
a little jig in the ecstatic joy of the occasion. Then
their tongues began to catch up with all there was
to tell each other.</p>

<p>As soon as Mal had brought the Powell’s luggage
in from town and Judy had changed into her blue
jeans, she and Marjorie were all over the place. They
were like a couple of hummingbirds, here, there and
everywhere. They took a dip in the lake, a shower
in the boathouse, and afterwards, thoroughly content
and full of excess spirits, they dressed for the best
dinner that Judy had ever tasted. Marjorie’s eyes
snapped and her round face was all smiles as she animatedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
told the Powells and Alf what she and Judy
had seen and done.</p>

<p>Then Alf and Jimmy related how they had spent
the day first exploring a little in the woods, then
making plans for a camping trip that they were to
make later in the summer, and finally adding a little
to the construction of the shack. They were mighty
anxious to complete the bachelors’ retreat as fast as
they could, and this was the only reason why they
accepted an offer of help from Marjorie and Judy.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose,” Alf said, giving Jimmy a nudge,
“that they’ll really be any help. But we’ll let them
sweep up wood shavings and sort nails.”</p>

<p>“You’ll do nothing of the kind,” Judy said briskly.
“I’m going to put up a wall all by myself or I won’t
go near your silly old place.”</p>

<p>The boys hooted and ran off to their headquarters.</p>

<p>But not much work was accomplished the next day
as more guests arrived. Brook Sanders was greeted
with hilarious shouts of joy by Jimmy and Alf when
Phil brought him in from the village in the station
wagon. Poor Brook was not even given a chance to go
to his room. But his parents were sure he preferred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
going down to see the shack with the boys. He came
back with a glowing description of the woods, the
lake, the picnic grounds, the shack and everything else
he had seen.</p>

<p>“Gee, Dad,” he said excitedly, “I wish you’d buy
the place next door. Jimmy says it’s for sale.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sanders laughed. “I can see you are all enthused,
Brook. But why buy a place as long as we
stand in with the Allens? This suits me.”</p>

<p>“Me too,” said Brook. “Let’s do this every summer.”</p>

<p>“Anybody want any fudge?” asked Marjorie and
Judy. “We’ve just made some.”</p>

<p>“I never say no to fudge,” said Brook picking out
the biggest piece before Alf or Jimmy could get it.</p>

<p>“You’d better leave at least one piece for me,” Alf
said.</p>

<p>“There’s plenty more in the kitchen,” said Judy,
“and we’re bringing in a big pitcher of lemonade,
too.”</p>

<p>Alf went into the kitchen with Judy to carry out
the lemonade and Marjorie brought in another dish
of fudge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
“Nut fudge,” gloated Alf.</p>

<p>“Nuts to the nutty,” quoted Marjorie from one of
her brother’s favorite expressions, as she passed him
the dish.</p>

<p>Jimmy, Alf and Brook spent the afternoon out in
the motorboat, to get away from the girls and to make
their plans. A great deal had happened to all of the
boys since they had last seen each other and they had
a lot of catching up to do.</p>

<p>The next day the Curtises arrived, their car loaded
with baggage, and Mary said there was more coming
by express. Now it was Penny’s and Philip’s turn to
get all excited and to catch up on old times with Mary
and Charles.</p>

<p>Charles greeted Penny in his old devoted manner,
and immediately asked if Peter Wyland, his chief
competitor, had arrived yet or if he was going to have
her to himself this summer. He made it very clear
that even if Peter came, he was planning to absorb all
of Penny’s spare time. Penny was cordial but elusive
and all the more attractive. Charles did not enjoy at
all her enthusiasm over the different members of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
party. He felt that the kiss with which Penny greeted
Mary should have been planted on his cheek instead
and he said so.</p>

<p>Mary and Phil, on the other hand, acted like the
two old chums that they were. They both laughed
heartily when Charles tried to kiss Penny and she
slipped hastily behind Phil.</p>

<p>“I can see,” Mary said, “that we’re going to have
a grand summer watching those two fight.”</p>

<p>Phil chuckled. “We’re delighted you all wanted to
spend the summer with us.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” Penny said, making a face at
Charles. “Even you, silly. I wouldn’t have considered
the summer complete unless the Curtises were here.”</p>

<p>“I know we’re going to have the time of our lives,”
Mary said enthusiastically.</p>

<p>“I hope so,” Penny said. “We’ve made all kinds of
plans. We’ll hike through the woods to the nearby
places of interest, and have picnics and all sorts of
evening parties.”</p>

<p>“And,” Phil added to Charles, “fish and hunt.”</p>

<p>“The yacht,” Penny went on, “is in fine shape. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
can go on overnight trips on the lake. Oh,” she finished,
“I’m just full of plans.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to let me help you play hostess?”
Charles asked.</p>

<p>“I certainly am,” Penny told him briskly. “And for
pity’s sake, start right in with all that baggage. I’m
sure Mal will be floored when he sees it!”</p>

<p>But all Charles could really get to carry up was
one small bag, since Mal, Pat, Jimmy and the other
two boys made quick work of getting the car unloaded.
Penny suspected the rush act was put on because
they were all anxious to drive the beautiful,
shiny Cadillac into the shed.</p>

<p>For the next few days the Lodge was a beehive of
activity. There was much conversation and laughter
and a great deal of coming and going about the
grounds. There were beach parties, hikes and picnics
and an impromptu evening party with everybody
joining wholeheartedly in all the games that were
suggested.</p>

<p>Jimmy arranged a “snipe hunt.” Phil was the only
other person besides Jimmy who knew there were no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
snipe around there. Everybody started out at twilight
with flashlights and paper bags to hunt for the elusive
snipe. And when they all came back, empty-handed,
one by one, Jimmy greeted them with a big stuffed
bird in his hands. Brook said it was an old logger’s
trick, and everybody in New England knew about
it, but he couldn’t understand how he and all these
other people would fall for it. Nevertheless, they had
all enjoyed their tramp through the woods and the
snack that awaited them when they returned.</p>

<p>There was little rest for the Allens now. Penny
would slip away when everybody was being entertained
to make out orders and menus. She also found
that she would have to make arrangements for some
of the village people to come in and help with the
cleaning as well as the ironing and serving when more
guests arrived.</p>

<p>Things were really getting down to quite a businesslike
basis, however, and Penny was pleased with
the routine they seemed to have fallen into partly by
plan and partly by accident. They had planned to try
and get all of their actual work done in the morning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
but the first few days it had not worked out that way
since most of the guests were up bright and early.
But after a few days, when the novelty of the Lodge
had worn off, and their guests had become quite settled,
most of them slept later, and this gave the Allens
time for their work.</p>

<p>Penny and Phil both had a disappointment in common
when Peter Wyland and Adra wrote that they
would not be able to come to the Lodge until the
first week in August. Adra Prentice was spending
some time with her father, whom she had hardly seen
all winter. And since Mr. Prentice could not come
to the Lodge at all as he had originally planned, Adra
had decided to spend July with him and then come
to the Lodge for August. Peter, of course, was in
Mr. Prentice’s employ, and so he could not come for
the same reason. However, they both wrote in their
letters to Phil and Penny that they would be there
in August and Peter hinted that he might be able to
come a week earlier.</p>

<p>“It’s a good thing we haven’t much time to miss
anyone these days,” Phil said and Penny smiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
“Yes, keeping busy is a wonderful antidote for
some things,” she said.</p>

<p>The next few weeks were indeed busy ones. Some
friends of Mary Curtis arrived and a few friends of
<a name="Charles" id="Charles"></a><ins title="Original has 'Charles’'">Charles</ins> dropped in for the weekends. Marjorie and
Judy were constantly on the lookout for new romances
among the young folks, and just as they were
certain that one was developing, something would
happen which would prove that they were wrong.</p>

<p>“Anyway,” Marjorie said to Judy, “there are two
romances we can be absolutely sure of. Phil is in love
with Adra, and Penny is mad about Peter.”</p>

<p>“And,” Judy chimed in, “Adra is in love with
Phil and Peter is wild about Penny. I wouldn’t be surprised
if they were all engaged before the end of the
summer.”</p>

<p>“Neither would I,” Marjorie said, her blue eyes
twinkling. “Phil and Penny can hardly wait for the
arrival of Adra and Peter.”</p>

<p>They had been helping Theresa by emptying all
of the scrap baskets from the various rooms in the
Lodge into the big wire mesh one in the clearing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
Later, when the wind died down, Pat would set a
match to the papers.</p>

<p>Right now the wind was blowing so hard that it
lifted a crumpled ball of paper from Judy’s hand and
blew it smack against Marjorie’s face.</p>

<p>“Fate,” Marjorie said with a giggle, “obviously
meant for me to read this before it got burned.”</p>

<p>Assuming an exaggeratedly serious air, she smoothed
out the paper on her knee. Then she gave a little gasp.
“Oh, Judy,” she cried. “It’s another anonymous letter.
Remember? I told you about the one Phil got?
This one was sent to Penny, and I’ll bet she crumpled
it up and threw it away without saying anything to
anybody.”</p>

<p>Judy nodded. “Penny’s like that. She wouldn’t pay
any attention to a letter she got unless it was signed.
What does this one say?”</p>

<p>“Th-this one,” Marjorie stammered, after reading
it quickly, “fr-frightens me.” And she read the
crudely printed words out loud:</p>

<div class="block-centre">
<div class="block">
MISS ALLEN: YOUR FALL THE OTHER<br />
DAY WAS NOT AN ACCIDENT. I<br /><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
PURPOSELY WEAKENED THOSE<br />
BOARDS IN THE SHED SO THAT THE<br />
FIRST ONE OF YOU WHO LEANED<br />
ON THEM WOULD CRASH INTO<br />
THE WELL. IF YOU DON’T CLEAR<br />
OUT OF THE LODGE SOON, EXPECT<br />
WORSE “ACCIDENTS.” I WARNED<br />
YOU THAT I MEAN BUSINESS.
</div>
</div>

<p>Judy sniffed. “Well, it doesn’t frighten me. From
the way you described Penny’s accident, I’m sure it
didn’t happen because someone had tampered with
the wall of the shed. Even if he had weakened the
boards, how could he be sure someone was going to
lean on them?”</p>

<p>“You’re right,” Marjorie admitted, completely
over her nervousness. “Penny herself said she was
foolish to touch that broken wall.”</p>

<p>She crumpled the letter and tossed it into the mesh
basket. “A crazy person who heard about Penny’s
fall wrote that silly letter. Come on. Let’s bring the
empty baskets back to Theresa and forget the whole
thing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
But deep down inside, Marjorie was thinking about
the footprint Jimmy had discovered in the dirt under
the shed floor. Had it been left there before Penny’s
accident, or after it?</p>

<p>“After it,” she finally decided. “The floor boards
were all in place the first time we inspected the shed.
The man who came snooping around that night must
have left that footprint. He probably meant to sneak
back and cover up the hole he made in the floor, but
got frightened away for good when Phil and Pat
fired those shots in the air.”</p>

<h2><a name="vi" id="vi"></a><span>CHAPTER 6</span><br />
CLUES IN A BOTTLE</h2>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">All during</span> the hot July days that followed Judy and
Marjorie did indeed live in bathing suits. Mrs. Powell
and Penny tried to make them dress up for dinner,
but they compromised by changing into clean shirts
and blue jeans.</p>

<p>“Aren’t we ever going to do anything about the
treasure that’s supposed to be buried around here?”
Judy asked one day. They had been in swimming and
were now lying in the sun on the shore of the lake.</p>

<p>“I suppose we should do something about it,” Marjorie
said lazily. “But it’s been so hot I hate the thought
of digging. Helping Pat hoe up his potatoes was about
all I could stand.”</p>

<p>“I’ve still got some blisters,” Judy said with a grin.</p>

<p>Marjorie raised herself on one elbow and squinted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
up toward the Lodge. “Penny and Phil don’t think
there’s any treasure buried around here any more than
there was a ghost haunting the place.”</p>

<p>“I know <em>they</em> don’t,” Judy said. “But Jimmy, Alf
and Brook do. They’ve been acting very mysteriously
ever since we got here. They sneak off early in the
morning with shovels and things, and I’m sure they
don’t spend all their time fixing up their shack.”</p>

<p>“I know,” Marjorie said thoughtfully. “And it
would be simply awful if the boys found the treasure,
not us.” She scrambled to her feet. “We’ve got to
find it first. Let’s get out of these wet bathing suits
before we do anything else. While we’re changing
into dungarees we can decide where the best place to
start digging is.”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the girls left the Lodge by the
back door and, armed with shovels, went down to
the clearing.</p>

<p>“Oh, golly,” Marjorie moaned. “I thought this
would be a swell place to dig because there’s no grass
on the ground here. But just look. There’s the wash
hanging out on the line to dry. Mr. Taggart must have
just brought it back from the laundry-mat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span></p>

<p>“Just our luck,” Judy complained. “We’d better
not dig anywhere near it. We’d be sure to raise clouds
of dust. It hasn’t rained in ages.”</p>

<p>“I tell you what let’s do instead,” Marjorie suggested.
“Let’s go help the boys with their shack. They
promised to let us work on it, too. Once it’s finished
maybe they’ll go off on that camping trip with Pat.
Then we’ll have the whole place to ourselves.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” Judy agreed. “If they caught us
digging, they’d be sure to make fun of us. They pretend
that we’re silly to believe that there’s treasure
buried around here, but I happen to know that they
believe in it too.”</p>

<p>When they arrived at the shack, the girls’ offer of
help was promptly turned down.</p>

<p>“<em>Help!</em>” Alf hooted. “Judy, you don’t know which
end of a hammer is the head.”</p>

<p>“Neither does Marjorie,” added Jimmy with a teasing
grin. “Scram, you two. We men have work to
do.”</p>

<p>“But you promised,” Marjorie reminded him
crossly.</p>

<p>Jimmy waved her away. “Later, child, later. Right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
now we’re too busy to teach you the rudiments of
carpentry.”</p>

<p>So Judy and Marjorie wandered forlornly off and
returned to the clearing where they had left their
shovels. After that they spent a few hours every day
aimlessly digging here and there for buried treasure.
But it was tiresome work and since they knew the
holes had to be filled up, they never dug very deep
or very long at any one spot.</p>

<p>“This is hopeless,” Judy said one day toward the
end of July. “What we ought to look for are clues.
Maps and things pirates may have left around which
will tell us exactly where to dig.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think there were ever any pirates around
here,” Marjorie said dubiously. “Didn’t they always
stick pretty close to the seacoasts?”</p>

<p>“I guess you’re right,” Judy said disconsolately.
“But whoever buried the treasure should have left
some clues or directions.”</p>

<p>“Not necessarily,” Marjorie pointed out practically.
“He might have buried it in a hurry and then
the Indians or somebody might have killed him right
afterwards.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
“I give up.” Judy flung her shovel on the ground.
“The boys can find the treasure first for all I care.
My hands are so sore I couldn’t paddle a canoe. So
let’s go swimming.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Marjorie agreed. “I do want you to
have fun while you’re our guest, Judy,” she added
worriedly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am,” Judy assured her with a quick smile.
“It was my idea to dig for the treasure, not yours.
But let’s forget about it for awhile.”</p>

<p>“Let’s,” Marjorie agreed. “Besides, I haven’t been
much of a help to Penny lately. I’m supposed to be
assistant hostess, you know, and help her entertain
the guests.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m a guest,” Judy said with a giggle. “And
you’ve entertained me royally.”</p>

<p>From then on Marjorie spent more time helping
Penny and Ann Mary and Theresa.</p>

<p>By the first of August the boys had made great
progress with the shack. Mal, Pat and Phil helped
out whenever they could and some of the guests
pitched in occasionally. The walls and the roof were
now up, the doors and windows were in place and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
boys had even spent two nights sleeping there on cots.
They were now putting in the finishing touches, and
true to their promise they had let Marjorie and Judy
help.</p>

<p>Marjorie, in her enthusiasm over being allowed to
put up a shower wall all by herself, had banged her
finger with the hammer and the boys had suggested
that she and Judy take some time off to recuperate.
So Marjorie and Judy were looking for shells down
on the beach.</p>

<p>“Oh, golly,” Judy said in disgust after awhile, “all
the nice ones seem to get as far under the rocks as
they can.”</p>

<p>“They certainly do,” Marjorie agreed. “But let’s
keep looking. We might find some really valuable
ones which we could sell to collectors for a lot of
money.”</p>

<p>For the next few minutes they were very busy
pushing and shoving at the rocks, upturning some and
giving up others that were too heavy to budge.</p>

<p>Finally they came across one huge stone that
seemed to be imbedded in the sand. Marjorie knew
that even with Judy’s help she couldn’t move it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
she was just about to crawl by it when she saw
something.</p>

<p>“Judy,” she cried excitedly. “Come here, quickly.
Doesn’t it look as though someone had been digging
around this rock a little while ago?”</p>

<p>Judy scrambled to her feet and joined Marjorie.
“You’re right,” she said. “Some one <em>has</em> been digging
here. I’ll bet whoever it was buried something under
that rock.” She flopped down on her knees beside
Marjorie and together the girls began to dig frantically
with their fingers.</p>

<p>And then Marjorie’s sharp eyes caught a glimpse
of something that glittered in the sunlight. “Diamonds,”
she gasped. “Judy, help me. Let’s see if we
can’t inch the rock up a little so we can see better.
Oh, wouldn’t it be wonderful if there was real honest-to-goodness
treasure buried here?”</p>

<p>Judy, tugging at the heavy rock, could only pant,
“There. Now we’ve got it!”</p>

<p>They both fell to digging with renewed vigor, and
in another second Marjorie could see that the glittering
object was only a dark green glass bottle.</p>

<p>“Oh, for Pete’s sake,” she moaned disappointedly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
“And I thought we were at last going to find the
buried treasure.” Crossly she yanked the bottle out
of the warm sand and raised her arm to toss it into
the lake.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute!” cried Judy, grabbing her arm
just in time. “There’s something in that bottle, Marjorie.
When you held it up in the sunlight I could
see right through the dark green glass.”</p>

<p>Marjorie held the bottle up again and stared at it.
“You’re right, Judy,” she said. “It looks like a piece
of paper. Oh, golly, maybe it’s a map which’ll tell
us exactly where the treasure is buried!”</p>

<p>As she talked, Marjorie was prying out the cork
with a piece of broken shell.</p>

<p>“Hurry, hurry,” Judy cried impatiently, hopping
up and down. “Now you’ve got it out at last. Turn
it upside down and shake it, Marjorie. Oh, oh, it <em>is</em>
a piece of paper!”</p>

<p>The piece of paper was battered and torn, and it
had been crumpled into a small ball. Carefully Marjorie
smoothed it out, and together they tried to read
the smudged words.</p>

<p>After half an hour of intensive studying they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
able to figure out that the scrap was a fragment of a
message, and the message had something to do with
“the Log Cabin” and “a well that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Judy,” Marjorie gasped. “The well must be
the one we dug up. If we could only find the other
fragment, I’ll bet the two together would tell us
where the treasure is buried!”</p>

<p>“Who do you suppose wrote the message?” Judy
asked wonderingly. “And how did it get torn? And
how did one half get into this bottle?”</p>

<p>“I can guess what happened,” Marjorie said, her
imagination completely running away with her.
“Two men knew about the buried treasure near the
old well. They wrote down just where they were
supposed to dig. Then they got into a fight when
they talked about how they were going to divide the
loot. In the tussle, one man got off with one half,
and the other put his half in this bottle and buried it
here for safekeeping.”</p>

<p>Judy stared at her in admiration. “You’re wonderful,
Marjorie,” she said. “That’s just what happened.
Now all we have to do is find the other half.”</p>

<p>Marjorie’s elfin blue eyes were bright with suppressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
laughter. “<em>All?</em>” she demanded sarcastically.
“The other half of the message could be anywhere in
the world.” She stared thoughtfully down at the
scrap. “The two letters ‘tr’ might be part of the word
‘trunk.’ What do you think, Judy?”</p>

<p>“I think you’re
<a name="absolutely" id="absolutely"></a><ins title="Original has 'asolutely'">absolutely</ins> right,” Judy said emphatically.
“Aren’t there some old trunks in the
storeroom that you haven’t opened yet? Oh, Marjorie,
do you suppose there’s another clue in one of
them?”</p>

<p>“Let’s look anyway,” Marjorie said. “Tuesday
when I was helping Ann Mary get the soiled linen
ready for Mr. Taggart to take into town, I asked her
if you and I couldn’t go through those old trunks
some rainy day. And she said we could. She laughed
at me and said, ‘You won’t find any treasure there. If
you’re smart you’ll search for rare shells down by the
lake.’ That’s how I got the idea of trying to find some
which rich collectors might buy from us.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Judy said, “we didn’t find any worth
bringing back to the Lodge. Let’s don’t waste any
more time looking for rare shells. Let’s go show this
clue to the boys.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
Marjorie hesitated. “Okay, but I’ll bet they just
make fun of us. Jimmy won’t even consider that it
just might be a clue.”</p>

<p>“But,” Judy objected, “he’s bound to realize that
the message had something to do with the well and the
Lodge. Let’s go.”</p>

<p>Marjorie carefully tucked the torn paper into the
pocket of her blue jeans. Then they raced back to the
Lodge.</p>

<p>Out in the shed the girls found that Jimmy, Alf
and Brook had finished closing in the shower. They
banged on the door and Jimmy called out in a dramatic
voice:</p>

<p>“Who invades our privacy? This is the bachelors’
retreat and we want no women around here!” Marjorie
heard him add in a loud whisper: “And especially
not dimwit girls!”</p>

<p>She yelled at the top of her lungs: “Oh, come on
out, Jimmy. Quit being so mean to us. We have
something important to show you.”</p>

<p>But Jimmy was adamant. “<em>You</em> quit banging on
the door, dopes. We’ll open it when we’re ready and
not a minute before.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
Marjorie turned to Judy. “Try Alf. He’s your
brother.”</p>

<p>“Alf Powell,” Judy screamed. “You’ll be sorry if
you don’t come right out. What we have is something
really yummy!” She added quietly to Marjorie,
“That’ll get him!”</p>

<p>“Yummy,” they heard both Alf and Brook repeat,
and then from Jimmy as he opened the door and stuck
his head out:</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you say you had food in the first
place?”</p>

<p>“Look,” said Marjorie, showing him the piece of
paper. “Judy and I found this in a bottle buried in the
sand under a big rock on the beach. We think it’s
part of a message that has something to do with the
buried treasure.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you dopey kids,” Jimmy said in a very condescending
tone of voice. “Your imagination works
overtime. It’s fantastic,” he said over his shoulder to
Alf and Brook, “what they can think up in their
spare time.”</p>

<p>But Jimmy took the paper from Marjorie, and gave
it a contemptuous glance. “What a mess,” he said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
“You know perfectly well you rigged this up yourselves,
but you can’t fool me.”</p>

<p>“We didn’t, honest,” Marjorie said, tossing her
blonde head. “But if that’s the way you feel about it,
give it back to me. Furthermore, if we find any more
clues you’ll be the last person in the world we consult.”</p>

<p>Jimmy tossed it to her with a grin. “Run along,
kids. We haven’t time for your monkey business.
We’re going for a swim, and then we’re going to get
the Bronc ready for our camping trip.” He slammed
the door in Marjorie’s face. “Scram. Later, if we men
haven’t anything better to do, you can try to fool us
with your phony clues.”</p>

<p>“See?” Marjorie bitterly asked Judy. “That’s a
brother for you! If we do find anything in the storage
room, let’s not tell a soul!”</p>

THE MAP</h2>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Marjorie and Judy</span> entered the Lodge by the back
door and found Mr. Taggart in the kitchen with a
big bundle of clean laundry.</p>

<p>“Hello, girls,” he said pleasantly. “Find any buried
treasure yet?”</p>

<p>“No,” Judy replied, “but down on the beach we&mdash;”</p>

<p>Marjorie nudged her and said quickly, “We found
a lot of absolutely worthless shells.” She grinned at
Ann Mary who came into the kitchen then with a
bag of soiled linen. “You and your rare specimens!
I’ll bet you sent us off on that wild goose chase just
to get us out of your hair.”</p>

<p>Ann Mary laughed. “Maybe I did.” She turned to
Mr. Taggart. “I really sent them down to the lake
to keep them from digging up the whole place. Pat
and Mal worked hard on the vegetable garden behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
the cabin, and I’m not going to have the kids ruin it
in their search for something which they know perfectly
well isn’t there.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” the laundry man said with a grin.
“A carrot in the hand is worth a diamond in the
bush.” He picked up the bag and started for the door.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, please,” Ann Mary said. “There’s
more upstairs. Sit down and make yourself comfortable
while I gather up the bed linen.”</p>

<p>“Do you want me to do it for you, Ann Mary?”
Marjorie asked, hoping the answer would be no.</p>

<p>“Thank you, no,” Ann Mary said emphatically.
“The last time you counted the sheets you counted
one of them twice.”</p>

<p>Marjorie giggled, and the girls followed Ann Mary
out into the hall. As she hurried up the stairs to the
balcony, Judy said:</p>

<p>“I wish you’d show me the secret room sometime,
Marjorie. I think you’re mean to keep it a secret from
me, your very best friend.”</p>

<p>“Why, of course, I’ll show it to you,” Marjorie
cried impulsively. “And there’s no time like the present.”
She led the way into the alcove and said, “See<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
those bookshelves? Now watch, while I press this
button.”</p>

<p>Open-mouthed with amazement, Judy watched as
the shelves moved aside, revealing a short flight of
stairs that led down into a little room.</p>

<p>“Why, that’s the most marvelous contraption I ever
saw,” she said enviously. “I wish we had something
like it at home.”</p>

<p>“We can’t go in,” Marjorie said. “It’s a law we
passed at a meeting of the Allen Lodge Board of Directors.
Only Phil and Pat can go in. As a matter of
fact,” she added thoughtfully, “I guess I shouldn’t
have showed you how the door works without first
asking their permission.”</p>

<p>“I won’t tell a soul,” Judy promised. “But why all
the secrecy?”</p>

<p>“Well,” Marjorie explained, “we keep all the
guests’ valuables and all the money in that little old
wall safe in there.” She stopped suddenly. “Oh, gosh,
I guess that was Ann Mary who just went by the
alcove. She must have heard us talking in here and
now she’ll guess that I showed you the secret room.”</p>

<p>“Will she tell Phil and Penny?” Judy asked worriedly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
“And will they bawl you out? Oh, I hope
not. It was all my fault! Curiosity killed the cat,” she
finished lamely.</p>

<p>“You mean,” Marjorie said as she closed the door,
“let the cat out of the bag!” She grinned. “No, Ann
Mary won’t tell. If she thinks I did let the cat out of
the bag, she’ll bawl me out herself. But she’s no tattle-tale,
and neither is Pat. They’re both grand people.
And so are the Donahues.”</p>

<p>“Everyone at the Lodge is swell,” Judy agreed,
and added cautiously: “Since we’re probably already
in Dutch, don’t you think maybe we’d better ask
Penny’s permission before we go through those old
trunks in the storeroom? I know Ann Mary said we
could, but after all, Penny is the housekeeper, isn’t
she?”</p>

<p>Marjorie nodded. “We’ll get her permission right
now.” She glanced at her wristwatch. “She’s probably
out on the porch having tea with your parents and
Mr. and Mrs. Curtis. And I guess Mr. and Mrs. Sanders,
too.”</p>

<p>“I tell you what let’s do,” Judy said. “Let’s put
on a fashion show. Didn’t you say that the trunk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
you’ve already opened is full of old-fashioned dresses
and costume jewelry?”</p>

<p>“What a wonderful idea!” Marjorie raced ahead
of Judy down the spacious hall to the porch.</p>

<p>Penny, looking very lovely in a pale yellow afternoon
frock, looked up from the tea table with a
smile. “Having fun, girls?” she asked. “I don’t have
to ask you if you’re hungry. Help yourselves to
sandwiches and cookies.”</p>

<p>“We’re not hungry for once, Penny,” Marjorie
told her with a laugh. “We came out to ask you if it’s
all right if we put on a fashion show for you while
you’re having tea. The boys have deserted us, and
Judy and I want to dress up and parade around in
some of the old costumes in the storage room.”</p>

<p>“Go right ahead,” Penny said. “That’s the best
idea you’ve had all summer, Marjorie.” She turned to
Mary Curtis who was sitting on the other side of the
table. “Don’t you think so, too, Mary?”</p>

<p>Mary nodded. “Anything to keep those two out
of mischief.”</p>

<p>Marjorie and Judy hurried away to the storage
room. “My, why haven’t we poked around in here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
before?” Judy asked Marjorie. “What’s in all those
boxes and trunks anyway?”</p>

<p>“I only know what’s in the trunk we already
opened,” Marjorie told her. “These are the old, old
trunks.” She pointed to two little trunks standing
side by side. “After the fashion show we’ll go through
them carefully for clues. The other boxes all contain
things of ours that we’ve put away so we wouldn’t
clutter up the house with things we didn’t need.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later the girls appeared on the porch
and marched sedately up and down, hoping they
were behaving like professional models.</p>

<p>It was all Penny could do to keep from laughing.
To her they looked as stiff as wooden puppets in a
Punch and Judy show.</p>

<p>“What period are you representing?” Brook’s
mother asked, suppressing a smile. “Jane Austen?”</p>

<p>Marjorie relaxed enough to shrug. “We haven’t
the faintest idea, Mrs. Sanders. Let’s pretend that the
audience has to guess.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Mrs. Sanders agreed. “I’ll stick to
<cite>Pride and Prejudice</cite>.”</p>

<p>“I’d say that the black velvet was of the nineties,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
after the big sleeves and hideous bustles had gone
out,” Mrs. Powell said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Curtis thought it was of a later period. She
laughed and said, “Wouldn’t it be funny if those
bustles came back in again. I’m afraid they wouldn’t
look quite as cute on us as they do on those two young
ladies!”</p>

<p>Mary told them she thought the blue satin dress
was meant to be worn with hoops and was probably
from a period dating near the Civil War.</p>

<p>“Let’s go see if we can find the hoop,” Marjorie
said, taking Judy by the hand and heading back to
the storeroom.</p>

<p>They had had enough of dressing up by this time,
and they got back into their blue jeans and proceeded
to turn the contents of the trunks inside out. They
felt every part of the inside of the trunks for hidden
places, they shook all the clothes carefully and examined
them minutely, but all to no avail.</p>

<p>“Maybe all of the costume jewelry in that box
isn’t set with imitation stones,” Judy said without
much hope.</p>

<p>“But it is,” Marjorie said. “Do you want to look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
at it?” She impatiently yanked off the lid and the old
velvet lining fell away. Then they both saw it&mdash;an
old map, pasted inside the cover!</p>

<p>Marjorie was so surprised she sat right down on
the storage room floor. “Oh, my goodness,” she
finally got out, “to think, if it hadn’t been for you,
we might not have even opened the jewelry box. I
never would have thought of looking here because I
examined it so carefully when Phil and Penny first
opened this trunk.”</p>

<p>But Judy wasn’t listening. She had hurried to a
window with the lid and was examining the map
carefully. “Marjorie,” she groaned, “this is positively
the worst thing that ever happened to us!”</p>

<p>Marjorie scrambled to her feet and hurried to peer
over Judy’s shoulder. In another minute she, too, was
groaning. “There’s no doubt about it,” she mumbled
sadly. “This map tells exactly where the treasure is
buried. And where it is buried is right under the
potato hills in Pat’s garden!”</p>

<p>“That’s the way it looks to me,” Judy said mournfully.
“He won’t dig up those potatoes until the fall.
The vines have hardly begun to blossom.” Very near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
to tears she added, “And&mdash;and you’ll find the treasure
after I’ve gone back to school!”</p>

<p>Just then Penny appeared at the door. “What on
earth is the matter with you two?” she asked. “I
could hear your moans and groans from the balcony.”</p>

<p>“We’ve found the map that shows exactly where
the treasure is buried,” Marjorie wailed. “B-but Pat
won’t let us dig it up.”</p>

<p>Penny’s blue eyes were dark with surprise. “Don’t
be silly, Marjorie,” she said. “Of course, Pat will let
you dig it up.”</p>

<p>Marjorie hurried across the room to show Penny
the map. “See,” she said pointing. “The big X is behind
the Donahues’ cabin on the west side. Judy and
I know what’s planted there. We got blisters on our
hands the day we helped Pat and Mal hoe up those
potato hills!”</p>

<p>Penny glanced at the map and then she laughed.
“You silly girls! Don’t you know that this is a joke
the boys played on you?” She went back into the
hall and called up the stairs:</p>

<p>“Jimmy, come down here right away, please.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span></p>

<p>Jimmy took the stairs two at a time. “What’s up?”
he demanded. “The house on fire?”</p>

<p>For answer Penny handed him the jewelry box lid.
“Didn’t you paste that map there to play a joke on
the girls?”</p>

<p>Jimmy stared at the map in amazement. “Honestly,
Penny,” he said soberly. “I never saw the darn thing
before.”</p>

<p>“How about Alf and Brook?” Penny asked sternly.
“A joke’s a joke, but this one might have caused
serious trouble. If someone not as thoughtful as Marjorie
had found it and followed directions he would
have ruined Pat’s potatoes.”</p>

<p>“I know,” Jimmy said, still staring at the map. “But
neither Alf nor Brook did it, Penny. They’ve never
been inside the storage room, so they couldn’t possibly
have planted this map in the cover of the costume
jewelry box.”</p>

<p>“Well then,” Penny said firmly. “The person who
did, did it purposely to annoy us.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how you can be so sure of that,”
Marjorie objected. “<em>I</em> think someone put it in the lid
long before Pat and Mal planted the garden.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
Penny gave her a fond pat. “I hate to disillusion
you, honey, but the map was pasted in the lid quite
recently. Last week when I opened the box to show
Mary the costume jewelry the old velvet lining fell
out. And there wasn’t any map there then.”</p>

<p>Marjorie sighed with disappointment. “Oh, dear,”
she began, “then I suppose the same mean person put
that scrap of paper in the bot&mdash;”</p>

<p>But she never finished what she had planned to say.
For just then Phil called out excitedly from the porch:</p>

<p>“Penny, <em>Penny! Peter’s here!</em>”</p>

PETER IS WORRIED</h2>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Peter had arrived</span> several days earlier than he had
planned! For a moment Penny stood stock still on the
threshold of the old storage room.</p>

<p>She was too thrilled to move, but she was very glad
that she was wearing her most becoming afternoon
frock. Peter said that pale yellow brought out the
golden lights in her hair and turned her eyes to violets.
Or was it forget-me-nots?</p>

<p>Marjorie’s giggle set her in motion. “Wake up,
Penny,” Marjorie said with a laugh. “This is no time
to dream.”</p>

<p>Her cheeks burning, Penny hurried down the hall.
Peter Wyland was just getting out of his car when
she appeared on the porch.</p>

<p>Penny’s heart beat a little faster as she greeted him
cordially and tried to look as casual as possible. Peter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
squeezed her hand lingeringly and looked as though
he were going to kiss her right in front of all the
people.</p>

<p>“You’re looking wonderful,” Penny said.</p>

<p>“So are you!” Peter’s eyes admired her smooth skin
which the summer sun had turned to a golden tan.
Neither of them could think of another word to say,
and yet they had so much to say to each other!</p>

<p>Philip came to the rescue with a cheery grin. “Hi,
fella,” he greeted Peter, shaking his hand as though
it were a pump handle. “Good to see you again.”</p>

<p>Charles came running down the front steps to greet
Peter enthusiastically, too. Penny thought:</p>

<p>“Good old Charles. He can be nice when he wants
to. If it weren’t for Peter, I think I could like Charles
a lot.” She glanced shyly at Peter. “Oh, he <em>does</em> love
me. I can tell!” Penny was in a whirl.</p>

<p>The first thing Philip wanted to know was when
Adra Prentice was coming.</p>

<p>“You’re in luck, boy,” Peter said, clapping him on
the shoulder. “She’s arriving in a couple of hours by
plane. Her dad&mdash;my boss&mdash;is planning to spend a week
here toward the end of the month.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span></p>

<p>Phil’s gray-blue eyes lighted up with anticipation.
This would be the most exciting day of the whole
summer for Penny and Phil.</p>

<p>“I’ll carry your bags up to your room,” he said
to Peter. “No, I don’t need any help. I know Penny
is dying to show you all over the Lodge and the
grounds.”</p>

<p>Marjorie watched them stroll off together arm in
arm. She was glad Peter was here and that Adra was
coming soon, but she did so want to be alone with
Penny for a few minutes sometime that day. “We’ve
got to show her the clue we found in the bottle down
on the beach,” she said to Judy. “Maybe the map is
a phony, but I’m sure the scrap of paper in my pocket
means something.”</p>

<p>“I am, too,” Judy agreed. “And I’m not so sure
that the map is a phony. It looked so old and weather-beaten.
Somebody might have found it just the other
day and put it in the jewelry box lid for safekeeping.”</p>

<p>Marjorie stared at her thoughtfully. “Who do you
suppose this somebody is who is lurking around here,
and writing anonymous letters? It must be the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
person, but how did he get into the storage room
without being seen?”</p>

<p>Judy shrugged. “Don’t ask me. Let’s talk it all
over with Penny the first chance we get. Then she
can discuss it with Peter. He’s sort of an amateur detective,
isn’t he?”</p>

<p>Marjorie nodded. “Heaven knows when we’ll be
able to say more than two words to Penny.”</p>

<p>Adra arrived just before dinner, and once again
there was excitement and tumult. Jimmy and Marjorie
greeted the lovely, fragile-looking girl with
shouts of welcome. Penny hugged her affectionately,
but Philip could only hold her hand in his and stare
down at her wordlessly.</p>

<p>But the expression on his handsome face told Adra
more than anything he could have said.</p>

<p>Penny’s duties as hostess and housekeeper kept her
busy until late in the evening. At last, when she was
alone in the office planning the next day’s program,
Marjorie and Judy could stand it no longer. They
burst into the room, and Marjorie blurted:</p>

<p>“We’ve been trying to see you alone all evening,
Sis. But, golly, you’re busy as triplets.” She stuck her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
hand in her pocket and pulled out the worn scrap of
paper. “Judy and I found this in a bottle buried under
a big rock down on the beach.”</p>

<p>Penny frowned tiredly. “Oh, Marjorie, not another
one of your clues!”</p>

<p>Marjorie bit her lip. “I know you think we’re silly
to keep looking for buried treasure, Penny. But this
is part of a message and it has something to do with
the Log Cabin and a well.”</p>

<p>Penny laid the scrap on her desk and tried to read
it. The girls showed her what they had been able to
decipher.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear,” Penny said. “I’m too tired now to
think about clues. I’m sorry, girls. Go on to bed now.
It’s late. Leave this with me, and the first chance I
get in the morning, I’ll show it to Peter. He’s the
detective of our group, and if anyone can figure what
this is all about, it’s he.”</p>

<p>After the girls had gone up to their rooms, Penny
added to herself: “I’m glad Peter arrived today for
more reasons than one. Something mysterious <em>is</em> going
on. Who was our prowler? Who wrote those anonymous
letters? Who put the map in the lid of the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
jewelry box? And what sense does this scrap of paper
make?”</p>

<p>The next morning, right after breakfast, she was
asking Peter the same questions. He listened attentively
as she filled in all the details.</p>

<p>When she had finished, he said very seriously: “I
don’t like any part of this, Penny, especially the letter
that threatened you. Frankly, I wish you had turned
it over to the police. Even if there were only latent
fingerprints on it, they could have sent it to the FBI
in Washington. Those experts don’t miss a thing, and
if the man is a criminal, his fingerprints will be in
their files.”</p>

<p>“But,” Penny objected, “if he <em>is</em> a criminal, he
would have been smart enough to wear gloves.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” Peter admitted. “But there are other
ways of discovering who wrote those letters. For one
thing, although he undoubtedly did his best to disguise
his handwriting, he couldn’t completely. No
one can. We all develop certain characteristics when
we first learn to write, and those characteristics stay
with us forever.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
“My,” Penny said admiringly. “You <em>are</em> a detective,
Peter.”</p>

<p>Peter grinned, and then sobered. “Not really,
Penny. And I wish you’d let me notify the police
now. Someone is obviously very interested in making
you Allens clear out of here. I don’t know why, but I
can guess.”</p>

<p>“So can I,” Penny said, twirling a strand of her
light brown hair around her finger. “Maybe Jimmy
and Marjorie are right after all. Maybe there <em>is</em> buried
treasure around here.”</p>

<p>Peter stared down at the note on the desk. They
had managed to make out the following words:</p>

<div class="block-centre">
<div class="block">
<div class="verse">
<div class="line">t the Log cabin</div>
<div class="line">t week in August</div>
<div class="line indent3">asure again</div>
<div class="line indent4">near the</div>
<div class="line indent4">r a well that</div>
<div class="line indent4">dry.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“The first word in the third line,” Penny said,
“could be the last part of the word ‘treasure.’ And the
well could be the one we dug up. But our mysterious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
Mr. X isn’t as smart as he should be. We went clear to
the bottom of that old well, Peter, and there just isn’t
any buried treasure there.”</p>

<p>Peter nodded. “The man first tried to frighten you,
and now he’s being as annoying as he dares.”</p>

<p>“Do you know what I think?” Penny asked. “I
think there is something valuable hidden around here
which we don’t know anything about. But Mr. X
does. He wants us to keep on thinking it’s buried
somewhere on the grounds so we’ll keep on digging
instead of searching elsewhere for it.”</p>

<p>“You’re not only very pretty, Penny,” Peter said,
smiling. “But you’re very intelligent. I think you’ve
reasoned it out correctly. The map and this fragment
of paper are red herrings; not clues. Will you let me
turn them over to the police? Just the paper our Mr.
X used may be a clue which would lead to the discovery
of his identity in a very short time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Peter,” Penny cried impulsively. “Let’s
not turn the mystery over to the police now. Let’s
first try to solve it ourselves. Besides,” she added
shrewdly, “when they hear about the night prowler
who attacked Mal, they may want to put guards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
around the Lodge. And that, Peter Wyland, would
make some of the guests nervous. It might ruin our
whole business venture.”</p>

<p>“I can refuse you nothing, Penny Allen,” he said,
grinning. “But I think we ought to consult with Phil
and Adra before we make a final decision. Let’s call
them in, and hash the whole thing out all over again.”</p>

<p>But an hour later, after a serious discussion, Penny
won. They would not notify the police unless they
received another threatening letter.</p>

<p>“I still don’t like it,” Peter grumbled. “The idea of
that coward threatening Penny.”</p>

<p>Penny blushed. Peter was being very protective
about her and she couldn’t help liking it. “But he
didn’t really threaten me,” she pointed out. “He
couldn’t possibly have known I was going to touch
the rotten supports in the shed wall. If you ask me,
he heard about the accident and simply took advantage
of it. A few hours after I tumbled down the well,
everyone in the village knew about it.”</p>

<p>“That’s another thing,” Peter said stubbornly. “If
we notify the police they’ll know who is a stranger in
town and keep an eye on him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
Penny laughed. “Then they’d have to have a thousand
eyes, Peter. The place is swarming with summer
people.”</p>

<p>Peter threw up his hands in mock despair. “Oh, all
right,” he said. “I give in. Let’s forget about it for
awhile. How about a swim, Penny? Or are you too
busy?”</p>

<p>“Well,” Penny began, “I&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Skip it, Sis,” Phil interrupted. “Pleasure comes before
business, since your main duty is to see that your
guests are happy.”</p>

<p>The meeting broke up then, and everyone hurried
off to change into bathing suits. Down on dock they
found Marjorie and Judy sitting on the edge, dangling
their feet in the water.</p>

<p>Jimmy, Alf and Brook were busy completing
preparations for their camping trip which was to start
the next day. The boys were fixing two of the canoes
to take along on the Bronc. They were planning to do
some fishing in the rivers they camped by, and were
going to be fully prepared to take advantage of anything
else they might find.</p>

<p>That evening they had an old-fashioned square<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
dance out on the front porch. There was a fiddler in
the town who had come back with Mal, and the
guests as well as the Allens had a lively time. Kitty
and Ann Mary served delicious cold lemonade with
homemade cookies.</p>

<p>Philip reached for his fourth cooky and said to
Adra, “I’m sure I’d get too fat to move if I ate all the
good things Ann Mary is always making. Can you
make cookies like this, Adra?”</p>

<p>She laughed and said, “No, Phil, I can’t make anything
as good as Ann Mary does, but I’m sure I could
learn, if I was offered an incentive.”</p>

<p>“Would I be incentive enough?” asked Phil.</p>

<p>“You would, indeed!” said Adra promptly. “But
I’m afraid we couldn’t live on just cookies.”</p>

<p>Phil laughed and said, “That might be fun for a
little while. I’m sure Marjorie and Jimmy would think
so. They can eat at least two dozen at a time without
even trying. I’m so glad you’re going to be here for
the rest of the summer, Adra, we have so much to talk
about. I want to tell you of my plans for the winter.
I’m going to try to take a job where I can be near
you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
“Oh, Phil, that will be wonderful,” cried Adra. “I
can’t <a name="think" id="think"></a><ins title="Original has 'thing'">think</ins> of anything I would like better. You know
Peter and I have become very good friends since he
has been working for my father, and he told me he
would like to find something so that he could be closer
to Penny. Does Penny know how much he likes her?”</p>

<p>“I think she does, Adra, because, you see, she likes
Peter just as much.” Phil and Adra looked very happy
as they strolled off hand in hand.</p>

<p>Penny, watching them, said to Peter, “I’m glad our
mysterious Mr. X isn’t spoiling their fun. I wish you’d
forget about the mystery, too, Peter, just for the
evening,” she added wistfully.</p>

<p>He grinned cheerfully. “When I look at you,
Penny, I can’t even remember my own name.”</p>

<p>But Penny knew that, underneath his flattering
banter, Peter was worried. She almost wished that she
hadn’t told him anything about the mystery.</p>

CAMPING OUT</h2>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">The next day</span> everybody came out to wish bon voyage
to Pat and the boys who were leaving on their
camping trip for a week. All hands helped them get
their paraphernalia aboard the station wagon.</p>

<p>Pat was the last one to get in with the big box of
fishing tackle in his left hand and a huge picnic hamper
packed with good food in his right hand. Ann
Mary had seen to it that they would eat well the first
day they started out. For the rest of the week they
had the back of the Bronc well stocked with canned
foods which they expected to supplement with the
fish they caught.</p>

<p>They were all in the best of spirits. This was to be a
real adventure. Pat was taking them into the woods to
a fishing camp where Jimmy’s Uncle John Allen used
to go every summer. Alf Powell and Jimmy were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
the chief mechanics in case anything went wrong with
the car, and Brook and Pat were to be the cooks.</p>

<p>Marjorie and Judy had their noses slightly out of
joint because they had been hoping right up until the
last minute before the boys left, that perhaps they too
would be allowed to go along. But the boys would not
even hear of it, and Penny thought it would not be a
good idea, either.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” Judy said in a consoling whisper to
Marjorie. “Maybe we’ll find the buried treasure while
they’re gone.”</p>

<p>Just then Ann Mary came running out with an armful
of freshly ironed shirts for the boys.</p>

<p>“Mr. Taggart brought these,” she panted, “early
this morning. I told him he had to get them here before
you left. Theresa just finished ironing them.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” Jimmy said, “but they needn’t have been
ironed. For the next week we aren’t going to care how
we look.”</p>

<p>“Lucky dogs,” Marjorie said in an aside to Judy.
“Do you know what Penny said to me last night? She
said, ‘From now on you and I ought to change before
dinner into something besides blue jeans.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span></p>

<p>“I guess she’s right,” Judy said reluctantly. “Mother
has had the same idea all along.”</p>

<p>But in spite of how they felt, the girls recovered
from their sulks long enough to wave cheery goodbyes
to the boys.</p>

<p>“Have fun,” they shouted.</p>

<p>“Be careful,” called Penny.</p>

<p>And so at last, Jimmy, Alf and Brook were off on
their great adventure.</p>

<p>After driving all day, Pat and the boys pulled into
a little grove of pines, deep in the woods near a beautiful,
rock-strewn river. They made camp and got out
their mosquito repellent. Pat had told them the black
flies in this part of the woods were really vicious so
they had come well prepared for such an emergency.
Jimmy and Alf got into their high boots and waded
into the river to fish. The results of this little expedition
were not quite as good as they expected, but the
few small fish they caught were very sweet when
cooked.</p>

<p>They were up bright and early the next morning,
but that day brought no better results as far as fishing
was concerned. Pat suggested that they move camp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
deeper into the woods, near a little lake where he
thought the fishing would be much better. Jimmy seconded
the suggestion and in no time at all they were
on their way again. This time they made camp near
the tip of the little lake and early the next morning
they watched the mist rise from the lake and listened
to the birds singing in chorus.</p>

<p>This spot was so beautiful that Brook and Alf said
they would like to spend the rest of the week here,
even if they didn’t catch a single fish.</p>

<p>“I knew you’d like it,” answered Pat. “Mr. Allen
always wanted to stay here awhile,” he said to Jimmy.</p>

<p>“And no wonder,” said Jimmy, “I can’t wait until
we get out there in our canoe.”</p>

<p>The boys were all skillful with the paddle, and as
they skimmed along the lake widened, then narrowed
till it was not much more than a stream. Finally they
reached the other end and drew the canoe into a small
bay. Pat led them to a small log hut hidden in the
nearby trees. Here there was a curious storehouse for
food and extra equipment. It was built of small pine
logs and was raised high on a few posts. Pat explained
that this was to keep the food from getting damp, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
that if it were properly fastened no climbing bear
could help himself to the food.</p>

<p>The little bay where they had left their canoe was
the outlet for a stream in which Pat said there was
wonderful fishing. Pat said they would have to go upstream
a way against some rapids to get to the really
good fishing spot. He also told them that there was a
waterfall nearby and the safest thing would be for all
of them to do all of their exploring, fishing, hunting,
or anything else they decided to do, in groups. Pat
cautioned them about the strong current in the stream,
too.</p>

<p>“Come on,” said Jimmy. “Let’s do some fishing
now and go up those rapids tomorrow.”</p>

<p>They caught a beautiful trout and a bass for their
supper and considered that a perfect end to a successful
and happy day. They decided to spend the night
in the small log campers’ hut.</p>

<p>The next day’s plan was changed when morning
came. The woods about the camp were explored and
found to be fairly open. It was full of birds, squirrels,
chipmunks and other small animals. Brook almost
caught a flying squirrel and claimed that he saw a wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
cat. There were beavers building in a small stream that
wandered through the pines and widened not far from
the lake. A graceful deer took flight as Pat, who was
in the lead, approached. This caused considerable excitement
and all chatter ceased as they stole on in the
hope of surprising another deer or a bear.</p>

<p>They climbed trees, investigated nests and Jimmy
kept looking for bees. The boys wanted to know why,
and he replied that the bees would lead them to a
“honey tree,” and there they might find a bear.</p>

<p>“Go to it, Jimmy,” cried Alf. “I bet we take the
honey first.”</p>

<p>They finally did see a bear, a black one of moderate
size. It ambled off before them from the water’s edge.
None of them had the heart to shoot it or anything
else they saw. They were having such a wonderful
time just investigating.</p>

<p>Around the campfire that night they sang and told
stories and when it began to turn very chilly they
turned in. They were awakened early in the morning
by the bird chorus. Alf said it was not so hard to get
up here as at home, in school time! They took the
canoe up the rocky stream with its dashing waters and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
strong current. By noon they had reached the highest
point from which these rapids started. It was quiet at
noon and the sun was hot. The perspiring boys sat
around in their bathing shorts and ate a cold lunch.
Then they got down to the real business of fishing.
Jimmy drew in a handsome black bass, and then the
competition became keen. Brook caught a beautiful
brook trout, and it was a jolly group of boys that sat
near the shore to clean their fish in the late afternoon
when they had returned to the hut.</p>

<p>Jimmy had started the fire and then joined the rest,
picking up the first fish at hand, a fine trout. “Who
caught this?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I’ll have you know that I’m the guy,” grinned Pat,
looking up from the bass he was cleaning and waving
his knife in the air. “It’s worth-while fishing where
there’s something to catch!”</p>

<p>“Isn’t this a walleyed perch, Jimmy?” asked Brook.</p>

<p>“I guess so.” Jimmy had started in vigorously to
clean the trout and now raised a loud voice in the ditty
of “Ham and Eggs.” The others joined in, making the
shore ring with the sound. The fact that supper was
to consist mainly of fish made no difference. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
young appetites and overflowing energy they managed
to consume all of the day’s catch.</p>

<p>The next day Jimmy and Alf wanted to take things
easy and do some swimming and lounging, but Brook
wanted to do some more exploring. They finally decided
to spend the day near the hut, and Brook made
a mental note to do some exploring on his own when
he could. While they were all in swimming, he paddled
off alone, down the main stream. He had gone
only a little distance before he was concealed from
view by trees and a curving shore. He entered the
main stream, which was quite wide as far as the fork.</p>

<p>There the division of waters left the wider stream
to the right. But that to Brook’s left offered the
prettier outlook. It stretched almost straight before
him to some distance and descended in a little rapids.
These looked easy, he thought, and though there were
rocks, the water looked shallow enough for a good
swimmer not to be troubled with any difficulty about
reaching shore or a rock in case the canoe upset.</p>

<p>A little peninsula, dotted with green trees and
bushes, jutted out from the left shore. Brook thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
he caught a glimpse of someone moving there and
started into the left fork of the stream.</p>

<p>“After all,” he reflected, “as the crow flies I’m only
a couple of miles from camp. Maybe Jimmy and Alf
have been out exploring and are over there on the
point.”</p>

<p>Then he saw something that made him paddle
faster than ever. He could hear the sound of dashing
waters further on but he was too excited to pay any
attention to it. What he had glimpsed looked like a
human body, sprawling half in and half out of the
bushes of a cove on the point.</p>

<p>Brook nosed his canoe into the cove, beached it,
and climbed up the gentle incline. Then he saw that
what had attracted his attention was only an old tattered
coat. It was rain-shriveled and had obviously
been flung over a rock to dry. But from the stream it
had looked like the torso of a human body.</p>

<p>“Well,” Brook sighed with relief. “Thank goodness
no one was hurt or killed.”</p>

<p>He went into the brush, past a few spruces, and
found a small clearing. In the mud here were footprints<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
which had obviously been made very recently.
It had rained the night before, clearing just before
dawn. Sometime between then and now someone had
walked across the clearing and into the brush. And
back again into the woods on the other side of the
clearing, Brook reflected as he studied the footprints.</p>

<p>Whoever it was might have hung his coat on the
rock to dry if he had been caught in the early morning
rainstorm.</p>

<p>“Probably a tramp,” he decided and went back to
the coat. He lifted it rather gingerly, and then, because
he could not resist the temptation, turned its
pockets inside out. To his surprise, he found in the last
pocket a letter. It looked as though it had been soaked
by the rain and had been dried again by the sun which
had been shining upon the coat and rock all morning.</p>

<p>The address upon the torn envelope was blurred,
and Brook’s curiosity was hindered by the fact that it
was almost lunch time and it might be well to hurry
back. Sticking the letter into the waterproof zippered
pocket of his bathing trunks, he hurried to his canoe,
pushed out and entered the stream again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
As Brook got back into the middle of the stream he
suddenly discovered that no paddling was necessary
to make his canoe go! The descent which looked so
gradual drew canoe and the water itself down rapidly.
The current was much stronger than one would have
thought! Brook used his paddle skillfully. He was enjoying
this exhilarating experience. It was great!</p>

<p>But when he tried to skim around a few rocks to
the point, he almost upset the canoe and only by a
quick push from a rock did he avoid being thrown
out. But the canoe righted and Brook sped on, past the
peninsula, around into a wider channel, for which
Brook was at first glad. There was more space between
rocks.</p>

<p>But the current was stronger, his control over the
canoe was getting a little out of hand. Brook was just
beginning to realize that he had had no business coming
off by himself, when he heard the sound of the
falls. His face grew pale, but he set his lips. The current
drew the canoe out into a wider part of the river,
and when Brook looked ahead for a minute he could
see a white spray dashing high over a pile of obstructing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
rocks. It did not seem so bad off to the right, and
Brook tried to edge over in that direction.</p>

<p>But what he saw ahead of him made him sick. It
was still some distance away, but the water was boiling
over at a little curve and fell somewhere below&mdash;he
could not tell where!</p>

JIMMY TO THE RESCUE</h2>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Back at</span> camp, shortly after Brook paddled off by
himself, Jimmy and Alf decided that they had had
enough swimming for one day.</p>

<p>“Race you to shore,” Jimmy yelled, flailing the
water in a fast crawl. Alf was slightly ahead of him,
but Jimmy soon passed him and was the first to throw
himself on the beach, crowing breathlessly, “Beat
you!”</p>

<p>“By a mere inch,” Alf said, flopping down beside
him. “Where’s Brook?”</p>

<p>Jimmy shrugged. “Probably back in the hut helping
Pat prepare a feast for our lunch. That guy’s always
hungry.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” Alf said. “It’s your Michigan air. But I
don’t think Brook is with Pat. I saw him drag one of
the canoes into the water just before our race. I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
too busy trying to keep up with you to see what he
did after that.”</p>

<p>“What difference does it make?” Jimmy demanded.
“Let’s go exploring by canoe ourselves. We can dry
off in the sun just in time for lunch.” He pointed. “I
want to investigate that fork of the first stream over
there.”</p>

<p>“I want to eat,” Alf said. “I’m starving. But if you
must satisfy your curiosity before I satisfy my hunger,
I suppose you must.”</p>

<p>“I can’t let you eat now anyway,” Jimmy said with
a grin. “If I did there wouldn’t be anything left for
Brook when he shows up.”</p>

<p>“I’ll say there wouldn’t,” Alf agreed, tightening the
belt on his trunks. “I could catch a fish right now with
my bare hands and eat it while it’s still alive.”</p>

<p>“You just had breakfast,” Jimmy said. “Come on!”</p>

<p>Alf lazily shaded his eyes with his hand and squinted
up at the sky. “About four hours ago by the sun,” he
said stubbornly.</p>

<p>Jimmy yanked him to his feet and called out to
Pat: “We’re going canoeing. Back in time for lunch.”</p>

<p>“Okay,” came Pat’s voice from inside the cabin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span></p>

<p>“You bet we’ll be back for lunch,” Alf said as he
and Jimmy glided out upon the lake. “What’s the coil
of rope doing in the canoe?”</p>

<p>“I brought it along so we could climb a bee tree if
we found one,” laughed Jimmy. “Anyhow it belongs
to Pat. I think it’s some of Theresa’s clothesline.”</p>

<p>The boys turned into the stream, and when they
came to the forking of the water, they entered the
narrower stream toward its right shore, where the
waters seemed quieter. While Alf paddled, Jimmy
made a loop of the rope and tossed it toward a stout
little spruce.</p>

<p>“This comes in handy,” said Jimmy, as the rope
caught and Alf paddled in close to the shore. “This
current is certainly strong,” he added soberly. “And
I imagine if we got caught in the center we’d be
headed for the falls.”</p>

<p>“Are there falls near here?” Alf asked.</p>

<p>“I think so. Don’t you hear them?”</p>

<p>Alf agreed and they discussed Jimmy’s plan of
either drawing the canoe ashore and footing it down,
or easing the canoe along the right shore. But there
was a tangle of underbrush along the bank and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
footing was uneasy. They decided to risk it because
they had the rope to throw out to some tree so they
could keep out of the current. They kept very close
to the shore and before they reached the peninsula,
they beached the canoe in a curve that was almost a
pool and hastened, over sticks and brush and stones, to
see what lay farther down.</p>

<p>“Well, we were smart to land, Jimmy,” said Alf,
as they stood looking at the stream where it flowed
beyond the little peninsula. “But it certainly is pretty.
We’ll have to watch our step getting down where we
can see the falls. Doesn’t she foam where she is going
over? Do you imagine the falls are high?”</p>

<p>“Can’t tell, Alf,” Jimmy said. “Looks like quite a
ravine down ahead; but this whole region isn’t very
high and it probably dams up into some other little
lake. Come on.”</p>

<p>“Wait till I go back after the rope, Jim,” said Alf.
“We may need it, if we climb down by the falls.”</p>

<p>Alf picked his way back the short distance to the
canoe and brought the rope. They followed the curving
shore toward the left, where the waters that swept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
past the point went wildly on in the wider channel to
fall over&mdash;somewhere.</p>

<p>Jimmy, with the rope over his shoulder, stood still;
Alf thought it might be better to strike through the
trees and avoid the rocks on the edge. Jimmy surveyed
the water at his feet, the scattered rocks washed by the
current, and looked upstream just in time to see
Brook’s face as Brook saw the falls ahead.</p>

<p>“Alf!” Jimmy yelled, horrified. “Look there! It’s
Brook!”</p>

<p>Only a moment did Jimmy stare. He slipped the
loop already made over his head and tightened it about
his waist. Alf needed no directions. What they had to
do must be done quickly. They both started running
to a point that would bring them nearer to Brook’s
course.</p>

<p>“Brook&mdash;Brook!” they kept shouting. “This way!”</p>

<p>Brook did not hear them, but just at that moment
his pale face turned toward the boys and he saw them.</p>

<p>“This way! This way!” cried Jimmy, beckoning.
If Brook could only get out of that awful central current&mdash;but
maybe it was all current!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
“He can’t come this way! I’ve got to throw him an
end of the rope.” As Jimmy spoke he was busy tying
a stone on the end of the rope to weight it. What a
risk it was! Jimmy was wading out to a great rock, in
a shallow where the shore curved. This was no game.
He must not miss.</p>

<p>Alf waded after Jimmy to help him hold on to the
rope. There was still a good chance, if they were successful,
to rescue Brook. It was some distance to the
falls, but now the canoe Brook was in seemed to be
coming faster.</p>

<p>Now. Jimmy threw, and Jimmy had not played
ball for nothing. Brook did not catch the rope, but
weighted by the stone it fell into the canoe and Brook
grasped it before it could slip back. Now his paddle
was whirling out of sight. Brook was standing up in
the canoe, with the rope tied around him, ready to
jump.</p>

<p>Alf braced himself, and Jimmy held the rope
tightly just in front of where it was around him and
drew it taut as Brook leaped. The rope drew in easily
at first. Then came the tug against the current. Jimmy
leaned against the rock to brace himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
It was all over in a few anxious moments. Brook had
bruised himself among the rocks, but he swam, crept
upon a rock, leaped to another, found himself in
quieter waters and was helped to his feet by two fast-breathing
boys who could scarcely speak.</p>

<p>“How&mdash;did you get here?” gasped Brook as they
helped him ashore.</p>

<p>“That’s the question we would like to ask you,”
answered Jimmy after a brief silence during which
they examined Brook to see if he had any broken
bones.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you about it,” Brook said shamefacedly.
“I&mdash;I’m awfully sorry, Jimmy. I hope the canoe will
come through all right, but I don’t see how it can. I’ll
make it good, Jimmy, I promise you.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see about that later,” returned Jimmy. “The
point is, are you all right?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;guess so,” Brook said sheepishly. “Got some
bruised shins, I think. It didn’t do me any good.”</p>

<p>“I’ll say not!” Jimmy grinned a little and took
Brook’s arms, working them up and down, one after
another. “Swallow any water?”</p>

<p>“Lots.” Brook was glad of that grin and he sheepishly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
grinned back. “My arms are all right, only sore.
I’ll be black and blue from that rock I hit first. But I
guess I deserve it.”</p>

<p>“Sure you do,” Jimmy said with a chuckle. “And
to think I thought you were at the hut with Pat. Gosh,
are we ever lucky! I guess none of us listened too carefully
when Pat told us to be sure not to go off by ourselves.
We’re guilty of the same thing you are, Brook,”
he admitted. “Well, this has been a lesson we’ll never
forget and I would say we’ve gotten off pretty cheaply
if it just cost us the canoe. Let’s get back to Pat right
away and tell him we’re all right.”</p>

<p>Alf and Jimmy helped Brook, who was white and
wretched after his narrow escape, and when they got
to their canoe they made rapidly for camp.</p>

<p>“Go limp, Brook,” said Jimmy, “and tell us all
about it.”</p>

<p>Brook grinned, and said he was “limp all right,” and
briefly told how he had tried to explore the little
rapids that looked so easy, completely forgetting that
there were falls in the vicinity. He also related the incident
of the coat and pulled out a wet wad from his
pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
“I was going to dry this,” said he, “and see if I
couldn’t read a little of it. Maybe I might as well
throw it away.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we can dry it yet,” suggested Alf, interested.
“Perhaps it’s a map to a treasure.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it isn’t,” laughed Jimmy, but he caught
Brook’s hand as he was about to toss the letter overboard.
“Wait. It’s still pretty flat in the envelope.
We’ll dry it out and see. How long were you there
when you found this?”</p>

<p>“Oh, about ten minutes or so.”</p>

<p>“Well, that ten minutes saved your life, kid,”
Jimmy grinned. “Alf and I must have left right after
you did and passed you. I wonder if you would have
made it over the falls if we hadn’t come along. I’d like
to go down later and see what it looks like over the
brink!”</p>

<p>“So would I, Jimmy,” Brook said.</p>

<p>Jimmy snorted. “You’re going to lie around this
afternoon, Brook, after we fix you up.”</p>

<p>Back at camp they found that Pat was just beginning
to get worried. He had kept their lunch warm for
them and looked rather cross as they beached the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
canoe. Then he caught a glimpse of Brook’s white
face.</p>

<p>“Well, out with it,” Pat said, frowning. “What happened
to you, lad? You look like a drowned rat.”</p>

<p>“I’m worse than that,” Brook said ruefully. “I’m
battered and bruised, too.”</p>

<p>As they all explained what had happened, interrupting
each other constantly, Pat carefully examined
Brook to make sure he was not badly hurt. “Just a
strained ligament,” he said, smiling reassuringly.
“We’ll have that shoulder strapped up in no time.”</p>

<p>He went into the hut for his first aid kit, and soon
Brook was eating as hungrily as the other boys. But
after lunch he didn’t argue when Pat said:</p>

<p>“Now, lad, you’re to take it easy the rest of the
day.”</p>

<p>The next morning Brook reported that outside of a
few bruises, he felt fine. Then they all went back to
see the falls.</p>

<p>“They’re pretty,” Brook said, musingly, “and
rocky, but not very high after all.”</p>

<p>A deep pool lay below, and there was the canoe,
bobbing around aimlessly near the edge of the pool. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
had a big gash in its side, but was not beyond repair,
Jimmy reported. He towed it up on the shore with
the aid of the trusty rope and a hook they made with
some wire.</p>

<p>“Maybe I could have swum out,” Brook ventured,
“but I’m certainly glad I didn’t have to try it. And
most of all, Pat, I’m glad you didn’t make much of my
disobedience of your order. Believe me, it won’t happen
again.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Pat. “Forget it&mdash;it merely was a bit
more excitement on a very pleasant trip.”</p>

<p>After their return from the falls, Brook remembered
the dilapidated letter and got it out. Everyone
gathered round him and they all tried to read it. It
was badly torn, obviously a good part of it was missing
and what little was left was hardly discernible.
They managed to make out the words <em>buried</em> and
<em>shed</em>.</p>

<p>Suddenly Jimmy’s face lighted up. “Say, do you remember
last week, the day we finished the shower,
Marjorie showed me a scrap of paper she said she and
Judy had found in a bottle on the beach?”</p>

<p>Alf nodded. “So what? They didn’t find it in any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
old bottle. They manufactured the whole story just
to kid us.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I thought,” Jimmy said, rather shamefacedly.
“But now I think differently. This piece
looks as though it had been torn from the scrap they
found.”</p>

<p>“Holy cow!” Brook stared at him. “And the girls
couldn’t have followed us and planted this part of
it in the pocket of that old coat.”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” Jimmy said, grinning, “although
if either of them could drive a car I wouldn’t have
put it past them. Besides, you said the footprints you
saw leading to and from the coat were made by a
man’s shoes.”</p>

<p>Jimmy stopped suddenly. “Footprints,” he repeated.
“Say, Brook, can we get to the place where
you found the coat by walking?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” Brook said. “It would take twice as long
as it would in a canoe, but,” he added ruefully, “it
would be twice as safe.”</p>

<p>“Then let’s go,” Jimmy yelled. “I want to have a
look at the footprints you found in the clearing.” He
turned to Pat. “Okay if we go?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
Pat nodded. “As long as you all stick together this
time.”</p>

<p>As they hurried through the brush with Brook in
the lead, Jimmy explained. “A few days before you
came, Alf,” he said, “we had a lot of excitement. I
told you how Penny fell down into the old well, but
I didn’t tell you that somebody came snooping around
the place that night.”</p>

<p>Alf stared at him. “You certainly didn’t. What’s
the idea of keeping secrets from one?”</p>

<p>Jimmy grinned. “The truth of the matter is that I
forgot all about it. First we figured it was a tramp,
and then when we realized that he must know his way
around our property pretty well, we decided it must
have been one of those dopey villagers who think
there’s buried treasure on the place.”</p>

<p>Brook stopped to turn around and glare at Jimmy.
“What do you mean ‘dopey’? If you don’t believe in
that buried treasure, why did you lure us into helping
you dig up every spot that didn’t have something
growing on it?”</p>

<p>Jimmy’s dark eyes twinkled with laughter. “<em>I</em> believe
in the treasure all right, but I wouldn’t be dopey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
enough to trespass on other people’s property at
night trying to find it. You can get a bullet through
your head very neatly that way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see what you mean,” Brook said, completely
mollified. He started off again at a fast trot. “Was
your night prowler a dopey villager?”</p>

<p>“We still don’t know,” Jimmy admitted. “He’s
never come back.”</p>

<p>“How do you know he hasn’t?” Alf demanded.</p>

<p>Jimmy groaned, clutching his dark hair in mock
dismay. “Will you guys puh-leeze let me try to explain
to you why I want to look at the footprints in
the clearing? Of course we don’t know for sure,” he
said sourly to Alf, “that our snoopy friend didn’t
come back. We only watched out for him that first
night. But with all the people who are at the Lodge
now I feel certain one of us would have heard a
night <a name="prowler" id="prowler"></a><ins title="Original has 'prowler?'">prowler.</ins>”</p>

<p>“I’m not at all sure of that,” Alf said stubbornly.
“We all sleep like logs. After a day with a slave
driver like you I can barely keep my eyes open long
enough to get undressed and topple into bed.”</p>

<p>“Shut up, Alf,” Brook said over his shoulder. “Let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
the slavedriver tell us why we’re taking this long trek
through the thickest part of the woods.”</p>

<p>“Footprints,” Jimmy said in exasperation. “After
Phil and Pat fired a couple of shots in the air, the
prowler scrammed. Then we went down to have a
look at the shed. And sure enough, somebody had
been there since we had left. Right near the spot
where Penny fell through the rotten wall, some floor
boards had been ripped up and there was a footprint
in the dirt staring us in the face.”</p>

<p>“That guy <em>was</em> dopey,” Alf muttered. “If he had
to go around leaving footprints all over the place, why
didn’t he at least put the floor boards back so you
wouldn’t find them?”</p>

<p>Jimmy shrugged. “I figure he sneaked out from the
village to dig around near where we found the well.
But just as he got started he realized that we might
not yet have gone to bed. In that case one of us might
have seen the flashlight he must have been using. So
he slipped up to the house to have a look-see. And
then Penny saw him.” He chuckled. “After that he
didn’t have time to think about covering up his
traces.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
Brook stopped again and mopped his brow. “I’m
beginning to see that there’s a method in your madness.
If the footprints I saw in the clearing match the
one you discovered under the shed floor, then we’ll
know that the same man left the old coat out on the
point.”</p>

<p>“Your reasoning, my dear Watson,” Jimmy said,
grinning, “is excellent. I will elucidate further. The
same man is the owner of the scrap you found in the
pocket of said old coat. And since said note contained
the two words ‘buried’ and ‘shed’ my guess is that
the rumor about buried treasure is more truth than
poetry!”</p>

<p>“What are we waiting for?” Brook demanded.</p>

<p>“You,” Jimmy returned. “‘Lead on, Macduff.’”</p>

<p>After that they saved their breath and hurried silently
through the mud and underbrush until at last
they emerged into a little clearing.</p>

<p>“This is it,” Brook said. “Get out your magnifying
glass, Sherlock.”</p>

<p>Jimmy sank down on his knees and examined the
footprints carefully. “Rubber heels,” he mumbled
triumphantly, “and made by the same manufacturer!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
See that crescent with a circle around it? It’s a trademark.”</p>

<p>“Golly!” Alf and Brook yelled in one voice.</p>

<p>Jimmy stood up. “There’s only one hitch in the
whole deal. I’m sure now that there’s something
buried under the old shed, but Phil will never let us
dig for it as long as we need the shed for a garage.”</p>

<p>“Holy cow,” Alf groaned. “Then that means you’ll
find a barrel of gold after we’ve gone back to school.”</p>

<p>“Just our luck,” Brook said disconsolately. “I’m
never around when there’s any excitement!”</p>

<p>Jimmy threw back his head and howled with laughter.
“About an hour ago,” he reminded Brook, “you
were the very center of excitement. Cheer up,” he
added. “Maybe when we get back and find that the
fragment you found fits the one the girls found, we’ll
be able to read something that’ll convince Phil and
Penny we should do something about the ground
under the shed.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” Alf said without much hope. “But let’s
not stick around here any longer.”</p>

<p>“Let’s not,” Jimmy agreed. “I vote we go back to
camp and tell Pat what we have discovered. He pooh-poohs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
the idea of buried treasure as much as Phil and
Penny do, but when he hears that the footprints
match, maybe he’ll take the whole business more seriously.”</p>

<p>“<em>I</em> think,” Brook said, “that we ought to convince
him at least that we should go home right away. I’d
rather dig for gold than fish, wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>Jimmy arched his dark eyebrows with surprise.
“And you were the guy who was complaining a while
ago that I’m a slavedriver!”</p>

<p>Back at camp Pat listened soberly when Jimmy told
him that the man who had left his footprint under
the shed floor had left other footprints recently in the
clearing on the peninsula.</p>

<p>“Are you sure, lad?” Pat demanded.</p>

<p>Jimmy nodded. “It’s too much of a coincidence to
think that someone else with the same rubber heels
had something to do with this piece of paper which
looks like it was torn from the one Marjorie found.”</p>

<p>“You’re right,” Pat said. “Let’s head for home at
once!”</p>

THE MISSING FRAGMENT</h2>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Shortly after</span> the boys left in the station wagon for
their camping trip, Marjorie said to Judy: “Let’s look
at that map again. Penny could be wrong. Maybe it
does show exactly where treasure is buried.”</p>

<p>“Let’s,” Judy agreed. “And maybe we held it upside
down or something. Maybe the big red cross
doesn’t mark the spot where Pat planted his potatoes.”</p>

<p>They raced into the Lodge and down the hall to
the storage room. During the excitement of Peter’s
arrival they had left the map, still pasted in the lid
of the jewelry box, on one of the old trunks. Again
they took it over to the window and studied it
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Let’s see,” Judy said after awhile. “When you’re
facing north, west is on your left isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Marjorie nodded. “So there’s no point in looking at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
this darn thing any longer. If it isn’t a phony, the
treasure is buried under the potato hills.”</p>

<p>“I give up,” Judy said with a sigh. “We may as
well go down to the beach and try to find some rare
shells. I suppose that’s the only buried treasure I’ll
have the luck to find.”</p>

<p>During the next few days they filled a bucket with
shells which they hoped were collectors’ items, but
which Phil and Peter told them were worthless.</p>

<p>“That is the worst about being a girl!” Judy Powell
said in a moment of disgust. “The boys will come
back with wonderful stories about how many fish
they caught and the rapids they ran&mdash;and everything!”
Judy’s ideas of what the boys were doing
ran out.</p>

<p>Marjorie and Judy were sitting in their favorite
spot on the pier, dangling their feet in the water.
They wore their bathing suits and had just watched
the cruiser take off with a group of the younger
guests, exclusive of themselves. They had not wanted
to go since Mal had promised to take them on a picnic
in the woods. Just at this moment they were in the
old familiar throes of not knowing what to do next.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span></p>

<p>“Let them rave,” said Marjorie. “We’ve things to
tell the boys, too.”</p>

<p>“They wouldn’t think that <em>we</em> do anything,” said
Judy rather crossly.</p>

<p>“Maybe we could think up something different,”
said Marjorie, a little worried. “Aren’t you having a
good time, Judy?”</p>

<p>“My, yes! I didn’t mean that,” Judy said quickly.
“I was just thinking what a grand time they must
be having. I’d like to shoot rapids.”</p>

<p>“Come up again next summer and we’ll get Pat
and Mal to take us on a canoeing trip.”</p>

<p>“You probably couldn’t get my mother to say
yes.” Judy laughed. “Let’s go back to the house and
see if we’re missing anything.” Just as they started
back toward the Lodge they heard the loud honking
of a car on the drive.</p>

<p>“Oh,” cried Judy, “I’ll bet the boys have come
home. I wonder what made them come back before
the week was out.”</p>

<p>“Something awful must have happened to one
of them,” Marjorie gasped as they began to run as
fast as they could.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
Sure enough, the station wagon was parked in front
of the Lodge and the boys were tumbling out of it.</p>

<p>“They certainly don’t look as though anything
awful had happened to them,” Judy panted.</p>

<p>“Hi, everybody,” Jimmy was shouting to the
crowd that had gathered on the porch. When the
girls reached the steps they heard him say quietly to
Penny and Phil:</p>

<p>“Say, how about calling a meeting of the Board of
Directors right away?”</p>

<p>“We can’t, Jimmy,” Penny said. “Everyone is
busy.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” he said. “A meeting of the Allens
in the office. I’ve got something in my pocket which
I think the rest of the family ought to know about as
soon as possible.”</p>

<p>Penny could tell from the sober expression on
Jimmy’s tanned face that this was not a joke. She
beckoned to Phil and Marjorie and led the way into
the office.</p>

<p>“On second thought,” Jimmy said as he followed
her, “let’s get Peter in on this. I’d like to hear his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
opinion of the whole thing. Besides,” he added in
a low teasing voice, “he’s practically family anyway.”</p>

<p>Penny’s cheeks flamed. “Jimmy,” she said, mildly
scolding, “you never can be serious for more than
five minutes at a time.”</p>

<p>“I’m pretty darn serious now,” Jimmy said. When
they had all gathered around the desk, he closed the
door and produced the scrap of paper which Brook
had found in the old coat.</p>

<p>After one swift glance, Penny said, “Why, Peter,
the handwriting looks just like the one on the fragment
Marjorie found. Where on earth did you find
it, Jimmy?”</p>

<p>Jimmy explained and Penny frowned as she listened.
“Brook had no business taking that envelope
out of a coat he found,” she said.</p>

<p>Peter chuckled. “Maybe he didn’t have any right
to take it, Penny, but in my opinion it was put where
it was so that no boy could resist the temptation.”</p>

<p>Penny thought for a minute. Again she read the
blurred words, more carefully this time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span></p>

<div class="block-centre">
<div class="block">
We’ll meet a<br />
the las<br />
and look for the tre<br />
I’m sure it’s buried<br />
old shed nea<br />
has long run
</div>

<p>Then she pulled out of her desk drawer the fragment
Marjorie had found in the green bottle. The
two pieces fit together as perfectly as a jigsaw puzzle.
Now they could all read the complete page:</p>

<div class="block-centre">
<div class="block">
We’ll meet at the Log cabin<br />
the last week in August<br />
and look for the treasure again.<br />
I’m sure it’s buried near the<br />
old shed near a well that<br />
has long run dry.
</div>

<p>“Oh, oh,” Jimmy moaned. “That means more digging.
I guess we didn’t dig deep enough.”</p>

<p>“But what about the map?” Marjorie demanded.
“It showed that treasure was buried behind the Donahues’
cabin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span></p>

<p>“None of it makes any sense,” Peter said calmly.
“And you kids may as well accept the fact right now
that the map and the two fragments aren’t clues.
They’re obviously red herrings, deliberately planted
to keep us busy looking for buried treasure.”</p>

<p>“I don’t get it,” Jimmy said frankly.</p>

<p>“It’s this way,” Phil explained. “Peter, Penny and
I figure that there <em>is</em> something valuable hidden
around here. Somebody who obviously isn’t honest
knows where it is. He wants to keep us from finding
it.”</p>

<p>“Oh golly,” Marjorie broke in, “wait until I tell
Judy about this. We’ll spend the rest of the summer
going over the whole place with a fine-tooth comb.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, you won’t,” Penny said, laughing. “I have
a better idea, and one that won’t drive our guests
out of their minds.”</p>

<p>Peter stared at her in amazement. “Have you been
keeping secrets from me?” he asked, pretending that
his feelings were hurt.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” Penny told him hastily. “The idea just
came to me this minute. Actually, the words, ‘last
week in August’ gave it to me.” Her cheeks flushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
with excitement, she went on. “One morning last
week when I was out in the kitchen discussing menus
with Ann Mary, she suggested that we give a masquerade
party. There are plenty of grand costumes
in the old trunks for all of the ladies, and you men
can rig up outfits from old curtains and stuff in our
boxes.”</p>

<p>“A swell idea,” Jimmy said. “But what’s it got to
do with finding hidden treasure?”</p>

<p>Penny smiled at him patiently. “If you’d only let
me finish! Ann Mary and I decided that the last
Friday in August would be a good time for the party.
Most of the guests will be leaving early in September,
so it would be sort of a last fling.”</p>

<p>Jimmy began to sing, “After the ball is o-ver. After
the guests have gone.”</p>

<p>“Stop interrupting,” Marjorie said, glaring at him.
“Let Penny finish.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Penny went on, “we planned the party
just for ourselves and our guests. But now I think we
should issue a blanket invitation to all the merchants
in town. It will be our way of expressing our appreciation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
of the way they cooperated with us all summer.
Now,” she finished, “you can all guess the rest.”</p>

<p>“Not me,” Marjorie said, rapidly blinking her blue
eyes.</p>

<p>Jimmy clutched his dark hair wildly. “I follow you
as closely as though you’d had a million-mile head
start.”</p>

<p>Peter was staring at Penny with frank admiration.
“You <em>are</em> smart,” he said. “Don’t you see?” he asked
Jimmy and Marjorie. “Our Mr. X, or our Messrs. X,
for there may be more than one, will certainly be
among those present at the masquerade. With everyone
coming masked and in costume, he wouldn’t miss
the chance. He’ll come out sure that he can get whatever
he’s after and depart before the unmasking.”</p>

<p>“Holy cow,” Jimmy exploded. “Penny <em>is</em> smart. Instead
of our wearing ourselves out looking for hidden
treasure, he’ll lead us right to it.”</p>

<p>Marjorie gave her sister an impulsive hug. “It’s the
grandest idea anyone ever invented,” she cried.</p>

<p>“And,” Jimmy put in, suddenly remembering the
main reason why they had persuaded Pat to cut the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
camping trip short, “I’m pretty sure there’s only one
Mr. X.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be a dope,” Marjorie said. “I’m sure there
are two. One of them put the bottle where he was sure
Judy and I would find it while we were looking for
shells. And the other put the coat where you boys
couldn’t miss it.”</p>

<p>Jimmy shrugged. “Maybe so, but the same Mr. X
who left his footprint under the floor of the shed
planted the coat.”</p>

<p>“Yipes,” Peter moaned. “What’s all this about a
footprint under the shed? I thought it was a garage
filled with cars.”</p>

<p>“It is now,” Penny explained with a chuckle. “Before
we converted it, someone ripped up part of the
floor and left a footprint in the dirt.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” Jimmy said. “And he also left footprints
in a clearing back where Brook found the coat.
Footprints,” he finished triumphantly, “with rubber
heels made by the same manufacturer.”</p>

<p>“Why, Jimmy Allen,” Marjorie gasped admiringly,
“you’re so smart you ought to get a job with the FBI.”</p>

<p>But Penny laughed. “Now all the red herrings fit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
together like the pieces of this paper. Don’t you see,
Jimmy? Mr. X deliberately left that footprint in the
shed in plain view so I might believe that he had had
something to do with my accident. Right, Peter?”</p>

<p>“Right,” Peter said. “As soon as Mr. X heard you
had fallen down the well, he wrote the letter which
you received the next day. Then that evening he
sneaked out to plant evidence which he hoped would
back up his threat.”</p>

<p>“Oh, gosh,” Jimmy said disconsolately. “We’re
right back where we started. But at least we can be
pretty sure that there’s only one Mr. X.”</p>

<p>“We can’t be sure of anything,” Phil said soberly.
“Except that whoever it is really does mean business.
The very fact that one of them jumped on Mal that
night when we chased him away proves that. An ordinary
night prowler would have tried to sneak away
without being seen.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Marjorie said cheerfully, “we mean business
now, too. And we’re sure to catch him the night
of the masquerade when he comes here to get the
treasure.”</p>

<p>“Wa&mdash;ait a minute,” Phil said cautiously. “What’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
to prevent Mr. X from getting by with his scheme?
We can’t be everywhere at once in a place as big as
this, especially when so many people will be milling
around.”</p>

<p>“And,” Peter added, “how will we know whom to
keep an eye on?” He smiled at Penny. “You planned,
of course, to have police detectives here in costume,
too.”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t,” Penny admitted. “I thought it
would be more fun if we set a trap and caught Mr. or
Messrs. X ourselves.”</p>

<p>“What sort of a trap?” Phil asked, frowning.</p>

<p>“I don’t know exactly,” Penny admitted. “But I
think it ought to have something to do with the secret
room. For one thing, Ann Mary and I planned that
just before the unmasking we might spring it on our
guests as a surprise. None of them except Adra has
any idea where it is.”</p>

<p>Marjorie felt very uncomfortable at that moment.
She opened her mouth to confess that she had showed
it to Judy, but decided against interrupting Penny
until she had finished.</p>

<p>“When we open the door,” Penny went on, “those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
who want to go down into the room will have to take
turns, because it’s too small to hold them all at the
same time. I thought that if anyone had been acting
suspiciously before that, we might be able to lure him
down alone and then we could quickly press the button
and lock him in.” She added, turning to Peter,
“Then you can call in the police.”</p>

<p>He shook his head worriedly. “<em>You</em> are not going
to be the one to lure him down into the room alone.”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” Jimmy said quickly. “<em>I</em> will.”</p>

<p>“No, you won’t,” Phil told him emphatically. “The
man may be armed and I’m the only one who has a
pistol license. I’ll go down with him and one of you
can close the door. If he’s really been acting suspiciously,
I’ll suggest that he unmask. If he’s the man we
want, he’ll refuse. Then I’ll produce my gun and keep
him there while I knock on the door. That will be the
signal that our scheme worked.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like the idea of your being locked down
there with him,” Penny objected.</p>

<p>“It’s the only answer,” Phil insisted. “Once he has
any idea that we suspect him, he may make a wild dash
for safety, and that would frighten some of our guests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
very badly. Besides, he might escape. With all those
people wandering in and out of the Lodge, I wouldn’t
dare use my gun.” He turned to Peter. “What do you
think of the plan?”</p>

<p>“It’s okay except for one thing,” Peter said. “What
if Mr. X doesn’t do anything to make us suspect him?
Up until the unmasking we won’t have any way of
knowing whether he is one of the village merchants or
not. And by that time he will certainly have disappeared.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s bound to do something to make him stand
out from the others,” Marjorie put in. “And he’ll
probably be very careless because he won’t have any
idea that we plan to catch him in a trap.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” Peter admitted.</p>

<p>“Sometimes,” Jimmy said with a teasing grin, “the
gal makes sense.”</p>

<p>Phil stood up. “If we’re all agreed, I may as well
go down to the village now and spread the word about
the party.”</p>

<p>“And I,” said Penny, rising, too, “had better go
through the stuff in the storage room and see what we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
have. I thought it might be fun to decorate the secret
room so it’ll look good and scary.”</p>

<p>“I’ll help,” Marjorie said. “I know where there’s
one of those old paper skeletons that we used to hang
up on Hallowe’en.” She slipped her arm through
Penny’s. “Oh, isn’t it going to be fun? Even if we
don’t catch Mr. X, the masquerade will be the best
event of the whole summer.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” Penny said. “And I hope we do catch
him. Even if he’s just a crank and isn’t after anything
valuable, he’s annoyed us enough. It’s time we put a
stop to it.”</p>

<p>She glanced back over her shoulder at Peter who
was still sitting at the desk.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear,” she thought reading the anxious expression
on his face. “He still thinks we ought to get help
from the police.” She shivered involuntarily. “Maybe
before the party is over we’ll be sorry we didn’t follow
his advice.”</p>

<h2><a name="xii" id="xii"></a><span>CHAPTER 12</span><br />
SETTING THE TRAP</h2>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">The next</span> two weeks were busy ones for everyone connected with the
Lodge. From morning to night there was a terrific amount of hustling
and bustling around the house, inside and out. Everyone was loaning
something or borrowing something to wear at the last big party of the
season.</p>

<p>Brook, Alf and Jimmy, all amateur but experienced electricians,
extended wires from the house to the trees so that the lawn would be
bright with lanterns.</p>

<p>“Just in case there’s no moon,” Phil said.</p>

<p>“If it rains, I’ll die,” Marjorie said nervously.</p>

<p>She and Judy were helping the boys, and Judy insisted upon knowing what
each one planned to wear.</p>

<p>“We’re all going as cowboys,” Jimmy called down from the fork of a tall
tree.</p>

<p>“How original of you,” Marjorie said sarcastically. “And it shows how
lazy you are too. All you have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span> do is stuff the legs of your jeans
in boots, tie bandannas around your necks, and borrow toy guns and
holsters from kids in the village.”</p>

<p>“So what?” Alf demanded. “With masks on nobody will recognize us, not
even you two.”</p>

<p>“We wouldn’t even try,” Judy informed him airily. “There’ll probably
be so many cowboys here that night it would be like trying to find a
needle in a haystack.”</p>

<p>“I hope Mr. X wears something more original,” Marjorie said without
thinking.</p>

<p>“Who?” Judy demanded.</p>

<p>“Er&mdash;nobody,” Marjorie said hastily. The Allens, at Peter’s suggestion,
had decided not to share their secret with any of the other guests.</p>

<p>“If too many people know that we’re planning to set a trap,” he had
said, “it won’t be long before Mr. X knows too.”</p>

<p>To change the subject Marjorie said to Brook: “Phil and Penny wrote to
New York and they heard today that I can get into that small boarding
school I told you about. It’s up on the Hudson. Golly, I hate to think
of going away from here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
“I know how you feel,” Brook said sympathetically.
“But just the same I’m glad you’re going to a school
that isn’t very far from mine. When we have dances,
you’ll come as my guest, won’t you?”</p>

<p>Marjorie blushed. She <em>did</em> like Brook, and it would
be fun to go to school dances with him, but she wished
he hadn’t asked her when Jimmy was around. Jimmy
thought it was fun to tease Judy Powell, but Marjorie
knew that he thought girls were a nuisance. He also
thought that boys who asked girls to parties were
dopes. She waited tensely for the caustic remark she
knew was coming.</p>

<p>To her surprise, Jimmy said nothing. He climbed
down from the fork of the tree and gave her a look
which said plainer than words:</p>

<p>“Watch your step, stupid. You almost let the cat
out of the bag.”</p>

<p>And then Marjorie realized to her dismay that all
of the others were staring at her curiously. Every one
of them had heard her blurt out: “I hope Mr. X wears
something more original.” They were overcome with
curiosity but they were all too polite to ask any more
questions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
Hastily Marjorie said, “Aren’t you all starving? I’ll
go ask Ann Mary if I can’t fix some lemonade and raid
the cooky jar.”</p>

<p>She was off without waiting for their replies, but
Judy raced after her. Marjorie’s heart sank. As soon
as they were out of earshot of the boys, Judy’s curiosity
would get the better of her good manners. She
would demand an explanation of Marjorie’s unfortunate
remark.</p>

<p>Then Marjorie had an idea. “You know,” she said
casually, “I’ll bet a lot of people come to the party
disguised as the ghost who’s supposed to haunt the
Lodge. I think of him as Mr. X and he wears a long
gray beard. It would be hard to see through that disguise.
I mean, a long flowing white robe, a wig and a
mask with a long gray beard.”</p>

<p>Judy looked disappointed but Marjorie knew that
her curiosity was satisfied. “It would be a perfect disguise,”
Judy said. “And much more original than a
cowboy outfit.”</p>

<p>Back in the Lodge they found all the other guests
busy making final decisions about their costumes. The
ladies had all enjoyed going through the trunks, spending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
one entire day rummaging, to the great delight of
the younger fry. Some of the people had gone into
town to get extra things for their costumes from the
local stores. They reported that the townspeople, too,
were all excited about the party and that a great many
of them were planning to come.</p>

<p>At last it was the day of the big event, and to Marjorie’s
delight the sun shone brightly in an almost
cloudless sky.</p>

<p>Penny had decided to wear the old wedding dress
from the trunk. It was beautiful even though it had
yellowed with age. Adra was wearing a green silk
dress with matching slippers from the same old trunk.
Penny and Marjorie helped each other fix their costumes,
and Marjorie suggested to Penny that she
should wear the veil that went with the dress and thus
really look like a bride.</p>

<p>“Because, Sis,” Marjorie said unashamedly, “you
<em>are</em> going to be a bride pretty soon. You might as well
start getting used to the idea.”</p>

<p>Penny’s cheeks flamed. Then she suddenly threw
her arms around Marjorie. “Oh, honey, if only I could
be <em>sure</em>. There’s no sense in my trying to hide from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
you that I love Peter. But how can I be sure that he
loves me?”</p>

<p>Marjorie sniffed. “Penny, you idiot! It’s written all
over his face whenever he looks at you. And when
you’re not around he mopes, except when he’s shooting
daggers with his eyes at Charles Curtis.”</p>

<p>Penny couldn’t help smiling. Then she frowned.
“But that doesn’t mean I’ll be a bride very soon. Peter
may love me, but neither of us has enough money to
start in housekeeping. Maybe,” she added wistfully,
“that’s why Peter doesn’t tell me now that he loves
me.”</p>

<p>“Pooh.” Marjorie snorted. “You can live on love.
Besides, we must have made a lot of money on the
Lodge this summer.”</p>

<p>“Not really,” Penny told her. “We had to hire an
awful lot of help, you know. And this whole month
the laundry has been so huge we had to pay Mr. Taggart
twice as much as he estimated in the beginning.
It had to be taken into the village four times a week.”
She sighed. “And the girls we originally hired to come
out only to wait on the tables and help with the ironing
had to work full time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
“Never mind,” Marjorie said consolingly. “It’s been
fun.”</p>

<p>Penny brightened. “Oh, I don’t mean that we
didn’t make any money. There’s enough to see you
and Jimmy through school. But Phil and I want you
to go to college. Both of you.”</p>

<p>“We won’t go,” Marjorie said stanchly. “Not if it
means you can’t marry Peter when he asks you to.
After the experience we’ve had this summer we can
both get jobs.” She pirouetted around the room.
“Don’t you think I’d make somebody a wonderful
secretary?”</p>

<p>“Wonderful.” Penny giggled. “But not a very dignified
one. No, honey,” she went on seriously, “don’t
you worry your pretty head about getting a job just
yet. Things will work out somehow. I know they
will.”</p>

<p>To herself she added, “If Peter asks me to marry
him, I’ll say yes. <em>Together</em> we can work things
out.”</p>

<p>“I tell you what let’s do,” Marjorie cried. “Let’s
have dress rehearsal right now. Here, in your room.
Just us and Judy ’cause she’s going to be my twin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
And Ann Mary so she can give our costumes a final inspection.”
She danced away.</p>

<p>In a short while they were all crowding into
Penny’s room, laughing and making fun of each other.</p>

<p>Marjorie and Judy were dressed alike in little Swiss
peasant girl costumes. Jimmy made a very handsome
cowboy and Philip was a swashbuckling pirate. A
banquet was to be served at midnight after the unmasking,
and since this was the event of the summer,
Ann Mary had included all her specialties in the menu.
She stayed at the dress rehearsal only long enough to
assure them that they all looked wonderful, then hurried
away.</p>

<p>In spite of last-minute preparations, the Allens and
Peter made time for a final conference in the office.</p>

<p>“Let’s try to have as much fun as possible,” Peter
said, “but we mustn’t forget for one minute that we’re
all detectives.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” Phil agreed. “If any one of us notices
a guest acting suspiciously, he or she must report
at once to the others. There’ll be over a hundred
people here tonight, so we’ve all got to be on our toes.
Every minute,” he added soberly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
Jimmy nodded. “Every minute until the unmasking
anyway. Which means between the hours of ten
and midnight. Not many people will arrive before ten
even though we invited them to come at nine-thirty.”</p>

<p>Penny was sketching a floor plan of the Lodge on a
large sheet of paper. “Whatever Mr. X is after,” she
said, “it obviously isn’t buried on the grounds. If it
were, he wouldn’t have planted those red herrings.
Therefore, it’s probably in the house. If it’s upstairs,
all we have to do is make sure that nobody but our
house guests and help goes up without our knowing it.
We all know what costumes they’ll be wearing so
that’s easy. But it will be Peter and Marjorie’s job to
keep an eye on the back stairs; Jimmy and I, the
front.”</p>

<p>Everyone nodded, and Penny went on. “If it’s
downstairs, Mr. X will know that he hasn’t got a
prayer of searching for it, unless it’s in the office or
the storage room, and I’ve locked those doors securely,
so he can’t slip in and out unnoticed. The other downstairs
rooms will be filled with people all the time, including
the kitchen. The logical time for him to try to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
find whatever he plans to steal will be when everyone
is gathered in one room.”</p>

<p>She smiled up at Peter. “In order to be sure we
catch Mr. X in our trap, I have carefully dropped hints
throughout the village that at eleven-thirty on the dot
we’re going to show our guests the secret room. Don’t
you think he’ll choose that time, when everyone’s attention
will be concentrated on one spot, to do something
which will attract our attention?”</p>

<p>“I certainly do,” Peter said. “He’ll be the one guest
at that moment who won’t crowd into the alcove to
see how the secret door works. Unless,” he added
thoughtfully, “whatever he happens to be after is in
the secret room itself.”</p>

<p>“I thought of that,” Penny said. “And since he can’t
possibly know how the secret doors works, he’ll wait
until after that part of the evening’s entertainment is
over. Then he’ll try to sneak back and go down into
the room while we’re unmasking.” She chuckled. “In
that case, he’ll walk right into our trap. After the last
guest has left, Phil can stay behind and hide in the
alcove. If Mr. X sneaks back and goes down into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
room, all Phil has to do is fasten the door from the outside,
once Mr. X is safely down the stairs. Then we
can call the police, for obviously no honest person
would go into the secret room without our permission.”</p>

<p>“I object,” Jimmy said. “According to that scheme,
we’ll catch Mr. X, but we still won’t know what he
was trying to steal.”</p>

<p>“I agree with Jimmy,” Phil said. “So instead of
hiding in the alcove after the guests have all seen the
secret room, I’ll hide down in the room itself. Behind
the black draperies you’ve hung on the walls. If he
sneaks back, I’ll stay there until <em>after</em> he’s got whatever
he’s trying to get. Then at the point of my gun
I’ll make him turn it over to me and&mdash;”</p>

<p>Penny interrupted with a frown: “I still don’t like
the idea of your being down in the room alone with
someone who may be a dangerous criminal, Phil.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Penny,” Marjorie cried impulsively, “Phil can
take care of himself. Besides, Mr. X won’t have any
idea that he’s hiding behind the black curtains. Also,”
she added, “what Mr. X wants may not be in the secret
room after all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
“That’s true,” Penny admitted reluctantly.</p>

<p>“Then the scheme is this,” Peter said, summing it
up. “If you and Marjorie see a stranger sneak upstairs
before the unmasking, you’re to report at once to
Phil, Jimmy and me. We’ll follow him and catch him
in the act. If no one does anything suspicious, Phil
will remain in the secret room after the guests have
seen it. Pat, who will open the door, will close it when
everyone has left the alcove. Then we’ll all go into the
big room for the unmasking and wait until Phil signals
that he has caught a rat in his trap. You can do that,
Phil,” he finished, “as we already agreed, by banging
on the door.”</p>

<p>And so the final arrangements were made. But
Penny, as she hurried upstairs with Marjorie to dress
for the occasion, knew that Peter was worried. He
didn’t like the idea of Phil being locked in the secret
room with Mr. X any more than she did.</p>

<p>“But,” she realized suddenly, “Phil won’t be <em>locked</em>
in after all. Even though we may deliberately play into
Mr. X’s hands by showing him how to get into the
secret room, he won’t know where the spring is that
closes the door on the other side.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
And, as Marjorie pointed out while they helped
each other with their costumes: “The whole thing
may be a flop. We don’t know for sure that there is
anything valuable hidden in the Lodge, or that Mr. X
will be among those present tonight.”</p>

<h2><a name="xiii" id="xiii"></a><span>CHAPTER 13</span><br />
PHILIP TRAPS A THIEF</h2>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Peter Wyland</span> knew that Penny would be coming
down the back way when she was ready, instead of
down the stairs from the balcony. When he was in his
costume he waited at the foot of the back stairs. The
large room at the bottom of the steps was dimly lit.</p>

<p>Presently Penny, a sweet vision, appeared at the top
of the steps. She gathered her draperies for the descent,
unconscious of anyone’s presence. The veil, which
Marjorie had persuaded her to wear, floated behind
her, caught back from her face by pins and a white
rose.</p>

<p>When she was halfway down, Peter stepped into
the light. “Penny,” he said in a low voice, “you look
lovely. I should have been waiting here with a minister!”</p>

<p>Peter was beside the surprised Penny in a moment,
leading her down the few remaining steps to the room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
where he tenderly put his arms around her and kissed
her. “I can’t wait any longer, Penny, to tell you how I
love you!” Peter’s voice was a little nervous. What he
had intended to say deserted him. “Will you&mdash;will you
wear a dress like this for me, soon?”</p>

<p>Penny, who had not had a chance to utter a word,
and whose breath was taken away by the surprise of
having Peter kiss her, merely said, “Oh,&mdash;why, Peter,”
as he led her to a little sofa in the corner of the room.</p>

<p>“Sit here with me just a minute, Penny. I’ve been
waiting to ask you for so long, only I’ve never known
whether you were just being kind and sweet to me because
you’re that way with everyone, or whether you
could like me well enough to marry me. I saw that
there was Charles Curtis&mdash;but if you were engaged to
him, I figured Phil would tip me off. I am sort of a
coward where you are concerned, Penny. Don’t tell
me that you like Charley best! Do you love me a
little?”</p>

<p>Peter’s voice was low and eager. He held one of
Penny’s hands tightly in his.</p>

<p>Penny was not the sort to keep the man she loved
in a state of uncertainty. “Did you know you’ve loved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
me all summer, Peter? I wish you’d told me sooner,
because you see, I’ve been in love with you, too.” It
was all right at last. “I knew last year that I loved you
Peter, but I couldn’t very well let you know it!”
Penny’s hand was almost crushed as Peter’s face lit up
with joy. He swept her into his arms again for another
kiss, and Penny said, “I could stay here and forget
all about my duties to my guests, but we mustn’t
forget about Mr. X. And I’ll have to go upstairs again,
Peter. See how you have mussed this veil.”</p>

<p>“Not beyond repair, I hope,” he said, smiling.
“Penny, before you go, say you’ll marry me this fall,
as soon as the guests leave?”</p>

<p>“Silly man! You take my breath away,” Penny
laughed. “But it is wonderful that you are silly about
me, Peter. I can’t think straight right this minute, but
we’ll talk about it later. Marjorie and Jimmy are going
to school in September. Phil is going to New York to
work for Mr. Prentice and to go to school nights. He
wants to be near Adra. Mercy&mdash;I’m all mixed up.
There will be so much to see to. Could you&mdash;could we
have our honeymoon right here?”</p>

<p>“I can’t think of a more wonderful spot,” Peter said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
“Our life is going to be all honeymoon from now on.
As long as I know we love each other that’s enough to
make me walk on air the rest of the evening. What a
pity we can’t be by ourselves. I’ll be thinking of you
every single minute, darling.”</p>

<p>Peter waited until Penny went back to her room to
repair damages. It took her but a few minutes and
when she made her appearance in the living room, she
was immediately surrounded and admired by everyone.</p>

<p>With the keen eye of an experienced hostess, she
glanced around to see that everyone was being entertained
in some fashion. She recognized most of the
guests regardless of their masks, and she noted that
there was quite an assembly of townspeople whom she
could not recognize because of their disguises. Mr.
and Mrs. Curtis were dressed as George and Martha
Washington and they looked very distinguished.
They were talking to Marjorie just now and saying
something that made her laugh. There was Charles
Curtis dancing with a lovely girl who had spent several
weekends at the Lodge and had come back for
the masquerade. When he danced by Penny he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
stopped for a minute and said, “I’ll wager that this is
our fair hostess. Shall I telephone the parson? It’s hard
to resist such a bride!”</p>

<p>“You are incorrigible, Charles,” Penny reported.</p>

<p>“And you look radiant tonight, Penny.” And off
he danced with his partner. It was hard for Penny to
get her mind on anything else except Peter. Dear,
eager, wonderful Peter. But she had many things to
do. The tables in the dining room had to be checked,
and then she had to return and take part in the party.
She looked around at the guests once more trying to
place some of those who did not look familiar. There
was one masquerader in particular who caught her
eye. He was dressed as the bearded ghost that was
supposed to wander about the Lodge, but aside from
the long beard and white wig he seemed to be quite
young, vigorous and active. He was too heavy for Alf
who had once said something about dressing up as a
graybeard. He was with Adra a good deal of the time
but mingled with the rest and danced well.</p>

<p>All the guests had arrived and the party was in full
swing. It was nearly time for Philip to announce that
he was going to show everybody the secret room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
Peter came into the room just a few minutes before
this and slipping an arm around Penny, he said, “Congratulate
me, Phil, I’m going to be your brother-in-law.”</p>

<p>Philip stared a moment, then put a hand on Peter’s
shoulder and told him there was no one to whom he’d
rather hand over Penny. “Good work, Peter,” he
said. “Congratulations. Even if she is my sister, I must
say you’re getting a wonderful girl.”</p>

<p>“Nobody knows that better than I,” Peter said
humbly.</p>

<p>“Stop it, you two,” Penny cried. “I’ll get a head too
big for my shoulders if you keep it up. By the way, do
either of you recognize that man over there disguised
as Graybeard?”</p>

<p>“I think that’s Mr. Sanders. He said something
about wearing such a costume when Alf gave up the
idea,” said Peter.</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t Mr. Sanders,” Penny said. “But there’s
something very familiar about him. I’m sure I know
him but I can’t quite put my finger on who he is.”</p>

<p>“Has he done anything suspicious?” Phil asked.</p>

<p>“Not a thing,” Penny admitted. Then she laughed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
“But he has been paying quite a lot of attention to
Adra. You’d better watch out, Phil.”</p>

<p>Phil frowned. “I’ll be glad when this evening is
over. I’ve hardly had a chance to speak to Adra since
breakfast. And&mdash;and, well I guess you two know how
I feel about her.”</p>

<p>“We do,” Penny told him, smiling. “But the question
is, does she?” She gave him a fond pat on the
cheek. “Faint heart never won fair lady, Phil.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” Peter said, grinning. “Once you get
used to the idea, Phil, proposing to the girl you love
isn’t so difficult.”</p>

<p>“I suppose not,” Phil said dubiously, “but if I rush
matters I might ruin my chances with Adra.”</p>

<p>Marjorie joined them then. “Nobody’s done anything
suspicious at all,” she complained. “The whole
scheme is a flop.”</p>

<p>“The evening isn’t over yet,” Penny reminded her.
She tucked her hand in the crook of Peter’s arm, blushing.
“We’re going to announce our engagement at
the banquet. And if Phil takes my advice, he’ll propose
to Adra before the party is over.” She smiled at
Marjorie. “Isn’t that enough excitement for you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, oh,” Marjorie cried, hugging Penny. “I’m so
glad. Wait until I tell Judy.” She was off, completely
forgetting to congratulate the bridegroom-to-be.</p>

<p>A short while after that Penny went upstairs with
Adra and told her that she and Peter were engaged.</p>

<p>“I’m so happy for you both,” Adra said, rather
wistfully.</p>

<p>Penny said nothing, but she guessed that when Phil
did propose, the answer would be yes. She hurried
downstairs again for, from the balcony, she could see
that the guests were already crowding into the alcove.</p>

<p>Most of the younger men, as Marjorie had predicted,
were dressed as cowboys, complete with bandannas,
chaps and guns in their holsters. Penny had
not been able to pick out Brook and Alf, but she knew
that Jimmy was the tallest cowboy of them all.</p>

<p>He was waiting for her at the foot of the stairs.
“Everybody’s all set,” he told her. “Pat’s pressing the
button that moves the bookshelves now.” When Adra
came down from the balcony he added, “Let’s wait
out here. It’ll only add to the confusion if we, who
have already seen the secret room, join the crowd in
the alcove.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
“All right,” Adra said, sitting on the bottom step.
“I’m exhausted. Mr. Graybeard is a wonderful dancer,
but he never wants to stop for a rest.”</p>

<p>“Who is that guy anyway?” Jimmy asked. “He
looks familiar, but I can’t place him.”</p>

<p>“Neither can I,” Penny said. “But then I can’t place
a lot of the people here.” She pointed to two cowboys
who were standing just outside the alcove. “For instance,
are those two guests Alf and Brook? I wouldn’t
know.”</p>

<p>And then Penny saw something that made her turn
and race up the stairs. The guns that those two cowboys
were slipping from their holsters were not toy
pistols. Even at that distance she could see that they
were small, but deadly-looking automatics.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Philip, in the alcove, was making
his little speech to the assembled guests.</p>

<p>“Ladies and gentlemen,” he said and waited a moment
for attention.</p>

<p>“There is one little feature of Allen Lodge that has
not been on exhibit, a place we call the secret room.”
Philip paused again, for effect this time, and a murmur
of interest ran around the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
“When we first moved into this Lodge we found it
accidentally and we decided to surprise you with it
tonight. This room has a curious entrance and when
I open the door you will see the little wall safe that
has held your money and jewelry. We are sorry to
say there is no other treasure down there. Believe me,
when we heard of the rumors about buried treasure,
we turned the place upside down to see if we could
find it, without success.”</p>

<p>Philip deliberately assumed a very disappointed
look on his face and the guests all laughed. Then he
went on, “But maybe the Allens didn’t look in the
right places, and possibly Mr. Graybeard, the ghost I
see here tonight, may find some treasure for us. Masks
and costumes are appropriate to our mysterious visit
to a mysterious room. Look for treasure! We will
have to go down in groups since it is a small room.
The people immediately surrounding me can come
down first and perhaps Mr. Graybeard will lend atmosphere
by posing near the safe.”</p>

<p>“I’d be delighted,” Mr. Graybeard said.</p>

<p>Philip glanced at him, thinking: “His voice is familiar,
but I’m sure he isn’t any of the merchants in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
the village we deal with.” Aloud he continued his
speech:</p>

<p>“When we come back up from the secret room
we’ll unmask and go into the big dining room for the
banquet. I hope you have all been keeping a list of the
people whom you think you have recognized. As you
know, we’re going to gather up your lists as you enter
the dining room. During the banquet, prizes will be
awarded to the guests who have guessed the largest
number of people correctly.”</p>

<p>After the applause that followed Philip’s speech,
Pat pressed the button that moved the bookshelves
aside. From then on Philip was kept busy leading one
little party after another down into the secret room.</p>

<p>Mr. Graybeard went with the first group and added
to the ghostly atmosphere by posing near the safe. Behind
him the paper skeleton dangled precariously
from the ceiling.</p>

<p>When the last guest had inspected the little room
and had gone back up the stairs to the alcove, Philip
said to Graybeard, “Thanks for helping us out. You
make a swell ghost. Who are you anyway?”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said a cold, crisp voice. “Turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
around and come down the steps with your hands
up.”</p>

<p>With one swift gesture, Philip released the spring
that closed the secret door. Then he turned to face the
gun Graybeard was pointing at him.</p>

<p>Philip was caught in his own trap, but at least the
man and his pistol could neither harm nor frighten
the people on the other side of the door.</p>

<p>Philip came slowly down the steps. “So you’re our
mysterious Mr. X,” he said coolly.</p>

<p>“Call me anything you like,” Graybeard said, taking
Philip’s own pistol from his pocket. “Now open
that safe.”</p>

<p>Philip shrugged. “Anything to oblige.” he said.</p>

<p>“And don’t try to pull any tricks,” Graybeard
warned him. “Upstairs, two men I hired for the occasion
are at this very moment relieving your guests
of their excess jewelry and cash.”</p>

<p>So it was a planned robbery! And Graybeard’s
henchmen had probably come disguised as cowboys,
carrying real pistols in their holsters!</p>

<p>For a moment, Phil was paralyzed with worry
about the girls. Penny and Marjorie were so impulsive!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
Would they submit quietly to a holdup? And
Adra?</p>

<p>He felt sure that the older women, although they
would be frightened at the sight of guns, would do
nothing which might arouse the anger of armed criminals.
But the girls!</p>

<p>The voice behind the mask repeated menacingly,
“<em>Open that safe!</em>”</p>

<p>Philip quickly obeyed. There was nothing else to
do. Peter had been right all along: They should have
called on the police for help.</p>

<p>Philip twirled the dial and opened the door of the
safe. “Help yourself,” he said curtly.</p>

<p>“I am very much engaged in watching you,” replied
the man. Philip had no choice. He emptied the
safe and handed its contents to the masked burglar.</p>

<p>There was a good sum of money, the payments of
the guests for the week. It was mostly in checks and a
great deal of the jewelry had been removed from the
safe for the occasion. Philip was thanking his lucky
stars that they didn’t keep too much cash, valuable
articles or important papers. Philip tried to get a good
look at the man’s face under his beard, but it and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
mask over his nose and eyes completely hid his features.</p>

<p>Could this really be the mysterious Mr. X? No,
Philip decided. Graybeard was nothing but a common
ordinary burglar. And yet there was something familiar
about him.</p>

<p>The man tucked the money into his pocket, then
looked contemptuously at the bit of jewelry but put
it into another pocket. Philip listened to hurrying
footsteps overhead and could see that Graybeard was
perturbed by them. But there was no catching this
man off guard. He held the gun close to Philip every
minute. He again ordered Philip to put his hands into
the air, while he felt around the inside of the safe.
Philip could not help but think what a curious picture
this man with his long gray beard made, as he searched
through the empty safe with one hand and kept his
pistol pointed at Philip with the other. What on earth
was he searching for?</p>

<p>Then Philip heard a little click, and suddenly a
drawer on two little steel rods dropped down from inside
the top of the safe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
“Missed that part of it, didn’t you?” Graybeard
sneered. “Empty that drawer and hand me the stuff.”</p>

<p>Philip was so surprised he stood there with his
mouth open for a full minute, then with great interest
he looked at this drawer that he had never seen before.
It was wide and shallow and full of papers. Evidently
a little hidden spring had released the rods that held
the drawer in place. Could this be the place where the
rumored treasure was supposed to be hidden? Philip
mentally kicked himself for not having thought of
such a possibility before. Much good it would do
them now. Idiot that he had been not to have taken
ordinary precautions that night. What fools they had
all been not to follow Peter’s advice!</p>

<p>No wonder Mr. X Graybeard had planted red herrings
guaranteed to keep Jimmy and Marjorie searching
everywhere for hidden treasure except in their
own safe.</p>

<p>“Quit stalling,” Graybeard growled, poking Philip
with his gun. “Come on, hand over that stuff and
make it snappy. The boys upstairs must be about ready
to go.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
Philip took from the drawer two packages of old
papers that looked like receipted bills, and a large,
bulging Manila envelope. This Graybeard snatched
from Phil’s hand and pocketed it with a satisfied air.
He glanced at the old papers and said, “You can throw
those away. What I want is bound to be in this envelope.”
He went on in a patronizing voice, “Thanks,
sonny boy. If you hadn’t played right into my hands,
I might have had to use some ‘soup’ to blow the lock
off that safe. Messy stuff, ‘soup,’ and noisy. When I
heard you were going to throw this ball and show
your guests the secret room, I decided to let one of
you dopey Allens open it for me.” He patted the
pocket into which he had stuffed the old Manila envelope.
“What I have here is much more valuable than
all the money and jewels the men I hired have taken
from your guests. They can keep whatever they collected
as their pay.”</p>

<p>“Just what is in that old envelope?” Phil asked,
stalling for time. The man, in the boasting, triumphant
mood he was now in, might be caught momentarily
off guard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
Graybeard chuckled evilly. “Wouldn’t you like to
know?”</p>

<p>“I certainly would,” Philip said and added shrewdly,
“I should think you’d like to <em>know</em> too. After all, it
may be stuffed with nothing but more old receipted
bills.”</p>

<p>The man, struck by this thought, glared at Philip
through his mask. “Never thought of that,” he muttered
and hastily shifted the gun from his right hand
to his left so he could reach into his pocket and open
the envelope.</p>

<p>In that split second, Philip went into action. Before
Graybeard knew what was happening the pistol had
been knocked from his hand. At the same moment,
Philip’s fist crashed against his jaw. Graybeard went
limp and toppled to the floor.</p>

<p>Phil leaped over his unconscious body to retrieve
the gun. Then he took his own pistol from Graybeard’s
pocket.</p>

<p>“Now the tables are nicely turned,” Phil chuckled.
He quickly tore strips from the black draperies on the
wall and tied the man’s hands and feet together. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
worked fast because he was worried about what was
going on upstairs.</p>

<p>Then he heard sounds on the other side of the door
at the top of the steps. Phil held his pistol ready. One
of the gunmen, worried by the prolonged absence of
Graybeard, might be coming down to see what was
happening in the secret room.</p>

<p>The door swung open, and, to Phil’s relief, Pat
leaped down the stairs. Phil met him halfway. “What
happened?” he asked nervously. “The girls&mdash;are they
all right?”</p>

<p>“Everybody’s just fine,” Pat said, grinning. “I’ll
tell you all about it later. Let’s see what you have here
first.”</p>

<p>He bent down and yanked the beard and mask from
the unconscious man’s face.</p>

<p>“Whew!” Pat and Phil whistled in one breath.
“Our nice cheap laundry man!”</p>

<p>For it was Mr. Taggart, and, as he regained consciousness,
glaring with rage up at Phil, his face was

FORGOTTEN TREASURE</h2>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Pat swiftly</span> untied Taggart’s feet. “Get up,” he ordered.
“Your pals are waiting for you in a nice shiny
prowl car in front of the Lodge.”</p>

<p>“The police,” Phil gasped. “But how&mdash;?”</p>

<p>Pat grinned. “The whole hold-up was a washout.
Oh, some of the ladies got a little scared when we all
suddenly found ourselves facing those cowboys and
their guns. And I was pretty worried about you myself
when I saw the door close and guessed you were
trapped down here with the ringleader.” He chuckled.
“Penny saved the day. Just before the hold-up was to
take place, she happened to notice that two of the
cowboys, who were loitering out in the hall, were
carrying real guns. She raced upstairs and called the
police.” He laughed at the chagrined expression on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
Taggart’s face. “The police arrived shortly after our
friend’s pals had collected their loot. In fact, they
walked out of the door and right into the arms of two
of the biggest cops I’ve ever seen.”</p>

<p>“Those fools,” Taggart snarled. “I told Jerry and
Rick not to let anyone out of their sight once the
secret door was open.”</p>

<p>Pat, as he deftly emptied Taggart’s pockets, told
him, “They didn’t exactly <em>let</em> her dash upstairs to the
phone in her room. She went so quickly and so
quietly they didn’t even know she wasn’t among those
present downstairs. When it finally dawned on them
that none of their victims was dressed as a bride, I
imagine they guessed that the game was up and decided
to scram without waiting to see what had happened
to their boss.” He gave Taggart a push. “Get
going,” he said gruffly. “There’s a nice shiny pair of
bracelets waiting for you.”</p>

<p>It was after one when the men returned from the
precinct station after preferring charges against the
three men. The girls were waiting excitedly for them
on the porch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, Phil,” Marjorie yelled, running down the
steps. “To think that Graybeard was Mr. Taggart
our laundryman, and none of us saw through his disguise.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Phil said, “it was a good disguise for one
thing, and he was careful to spend most of his time
with Adra who had never seen him.”</p>

<p>Adra smiled rather shamefacedly. “I’m such a lazybones!
He usually came in the morning before I was
up. When he did come later in the day I guess I was
always off somewhere having a good time while you
Allens worked.”</p>

<p>“That’s what you were supposed to be doing,”
Penny said, smiling. “You’re our guest, remember?”</p>

<p>“Never mind about that,” Marjorie interrupted impatiently.
“What I want to know is whether or not
Mr. Taggart was Mr. X.” She tugged Phil’s arm, leading
him to a seat beside her on the porch glider. “Did
he plant the clues we found and write us the threatening
letters?”</p>

<p>Phil nodded. “The other men were merely hired
by him for the evening to keep the guests out of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
hair while he looked for a secret drawer in the safe.
He made a complete confession before we left the
police station.”</p>

<p>“Oh, oh,” Marjorie cried jumping up. “Then the
mystery is solved. Tell us everything, Phil, right
now.”</p>

<p>He patted her hand affectionately. “Not now,
honey. First we must think of our guests. Family affairs
can come later.”</p>

<p>Once everybody was in the dining room, its light
and decorations made a gay setting for the return to
normal feelings. As Philip followed the last guest into
the room, Penny said, “Adra and I were just sick with
worry over you, Phil. I want to know every single
thing that happened as soon as possible! Are you sure
you’re all right?”</p>

<p>“I’m fine,” Phil assured her.</p>

<p>Jimmy, too, caught Philip and said. “Good work,
Phil. When do I get to hear the whole story?”</p>

<p>“As soon as the guests have all gone home or to bed
in the Lodge,” Philip said. “It’s a long story.” He
turned to Penny, “And it was your quickwittedness
that made it have a happy ending.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
“I didn’t do anything but dash up to my room and
call the police,” Penny said. “You’re a hero, Phil.”</p>

<p>By now, of course, everyone had removed his mask
and all the faces were familiar ones.</p>

<p>Philip moved on to a space at the central table where
he and Adra were going to sit together. He held her
hand in a firm clasp and her fingers twined in response.
Peter smiled at him and clapped his hands together for
order.</p>

<p>“Speech! Speech!”</p>

<p>Philip smiled at everybody and didn’t seem at all
nervous or upset after his experience of the evening.</p>

<p>“I’m very sorry,” he began, “that robbers chose us
for their victims tonight, and that I could not prevent
your disagreeable experience.”</p>

<p>“It was fun,” Judy interrupted impulsively. “For
the longest time I thought it was just an act Jimmy and
Alf were putting on. What I’ll have to tell the girls
when I get back to Cincinnati!”</p>

<p>Philip smiled at her and continued: “I hope that you
all can forget the unpleasant part of the evening and
that you will enjoy the feast Ann Mary prepared. I
have here the jewelry and wallets and handbags the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
armed cowboys took from you. As I hold up each item
will the owner please come and get his or her property?”</p>

<p>While the food was being served, Philip distributed
the stolen articles to their owners.</p>

<p>“I was much too surprised to be frightened at first,”
said Mrs. Curtis, calmly pouring cream into her coffee.
“Indeed, like Judy, I thought for quite a while that
it was some stunt the boys had thought up. The
young people today are always doing some crazy
thing.”</p>

<p>“I was nearly speechless at those guns,” said Mrs.
Powell. “I don’t know what the country is coming to!
But it was all over so quickly I don’t suppose I was
much more frightened than I would have been trying
to get across a busy street.”</p>

<p>“That, my dear, is slightly underestimating it&mdash;at
least for me,” said Mr. Powell. “I was just plain worried
one of those guns would go off.”</p>

<p>“I certainly hated to see my jewelry gathered in,”
remarked Mrs. Sanders.</p>

<p>The prizes were awarded, and there was music
afterwards. Some of the older people retired soon, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
as this was the last general celebration, the younger
set preferred to linger.</p>

<p>Philip, whose duties as host had been accomplished,
wasted no time, but took Adra to a moonlit walk and
pretty nook on the shore where they sat on the sand
and talked.</p>

<p>Philip told Adra of his feeling of responsibility for
his brother and sisters. “Now Penny is engaged to
Peter as I suppose she told you. This summer’s venture
will see Jimmy and Marjorie through school.” He
hesitated. “And, er, college. At last, Adra, I feel I
have a right to say, well, that the only treasure I ever
wanted is you!”</p>

<p>Adra’s blush was most becoming and gave Philip
courage to go on. “Could you possibly care for me,
Adra? You know your father has invited me into his
office and I want to go on with my college education
evenings, but somehow, whatever I decide to do depends
on you. If you care, I think we can&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Manage the rest,” finished Adra calmly, though
her heart was beating fast. “Yes, Phil, I care enough.”</p>

<p>Two happy young people walked back to the
Lodge about half an hour later. As Phil and Adra entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
they found most of the guests gone and Marjorie
and Jimmy curled up in big chairs on the porch,
sound asleep.</p>

<p>“Those two wouldn’t dare go to bed for fear they’d
miss something.” Adra and Philip laughed and went
back to find Peter and Penny raiding the pantry for a
snack.</p>

<p>“Ha!” cried Phil. “More burglars!”</p>

<p>“Yes; come join us,” replied Penny, unwrapping
some brick ice cream.</p>

<p>“Delighted,” returned her brother. “We need to
celebrate. Adra and I have just reached a momentous
decision and this Lodge can hardly contain me, big as
it is.”</p>

<p>“Honest? Oh, Adra, you perfect dear!” and Penny
dropped the ice cream to hug Adra with enthusiasm.
And Peter, who had caught the ice cream on his plate,
shook hands with Philip after carefully setting down
his burden.</p>

<p>“You know,” said Peter slyly, “Philip was going to
tell us what Mr. Taggart said when he confessed, but
I guess Adra has made him completely forget it.”</p>

<p>“That she has,” answered Philip. “Anything else<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
that happened tonight is very unimportant by comparison
with this. After all, that’s over. Exciting
enough while it lasted, but not nearly as interesting
as plans for my future life with Adra.”</p>

<p>“Listen to the hero make little out of his great adventure,”
cried Penny. “Phil, I can’t stand it another
minute. Begin at the beginning and tell us every word
Mr. Taggart said when he confessed. How did he
know there was a secret drawer in the safe, and what
was in the drawer?”</p>

<p>For answer, Peter led the way to the porch. “Wake
up, Sleepy Heads,” he said, nudging Marjorie and
Jimmy. “Wake up and hear a bedtime story about
hidden treasure!”</p>

<p>“Hidden treasure,” Marjorie repeated, instantly
wide awake. “Phil! You’ve been keeping something
important from us.”</p>

<p>“I told you it was a family matter,” Phil said, putting
his arm around Adra. “And before I told the tale
I wanted to be sure that Adra as well as Peter will
soon be members of our family.”</p>

<p>“I knew it,” Marjorie cried, giving Adra a hug. “I
told you so, Jimmy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
“Congratulations, you two,” Jimmy said. “I mean,
you four. Now, can we hear what went on in the
secret room tonight, Phil?”</p>

<p>“The story,” Phil began, “goes back to about
twenty years ago when Uncle John was a very rich
man and living in New York City. At that time he
invested $20,000 in a small company belonging to one
of his friends who told him that the stock was sure
to go up. But the stock didn’t go up. It went down
and finally its name disappeared from the Stock Exchange
boards and from the newspaper stock lists.
Naturally, Uncle John thought his certificates were
worthless, but, lucky for us, he didn’t destroy them.”</p>

<p>“Golly, Phil,” Jimmy cried enthusiastically.
“When you say ‘lucky for us’ do you mean the old
stock is worth something? Can I have a sailboat after
all?”</p>

<p>Phil grinned. “Let me finish, puh-leeze. About five
years ago, the company started paying dividends, but
it couldn’t locate a great many of its stockholders,
among them, Uncle John. He had changed his address
several times before he settled down here. So
the company officials turned the matter over to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
special detective agency which specializes in tracking
down owners of forgotten stocks. Notices also appeared
in newspapers throughout the country, and
Mr. Taggart saw one of the notices.</p>

<p>“With forged credentials, he got a job with the
detective agency and was assigned the duty of finding
Uncle John. Guessing that Uncle John was dead, he
planned to get hold of the stock certificates, and, with
more forged credentials, prove that he was his sole
heir.”</p>

<p>Phil turned to Penny who was holding hands with
Peter. “If it hadn’t been for you, Taggart might well
have succeeded. A girl not quite so level-headed might
have screamed when she saw those ‘cowboys’ drawing
real guns from their holsters.”</p>

<p>Peter squeezed her hand more tightly. “I can’t bear
to think about what might have happened if those
gunmen had seen you darting up the stairs.”</p>

<p>“Stop it, both of you,” Penny protested, blushing.
“Get on with the story, Phil!”</p>

<p>“Okay,” Phil said, smiling. “Taggart finally traced
Uncle John to the Lodge only to find that he was
dead and that we had started our business venture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
here. He had hoped to find the Lodge deserted so he
could search undisturbed for the certificates. He knew
that people leave old stocks and bonds in all sorts of
places. Sometimes they slip them under the paper
lining of bureau drawers or cupboards, or between
the pages of books. False-bottom trunks and secret
drawers in old safes, and so forth, and so forth. Taggart
realized that one of us, while we were getting
the Lodge ready for guests, might come across the
certificates. So the first thing he did was to try to
frighten us away.”</p>

<p>“That was silly of him,” Marjorie said with a sniff.
“He might have known that the Allens don’t frighten
easily.”</p>

<p>“Be quiet, imp,” Jimmy said. “He didn’t know anything
about us then.” He added to Philip: “So it was
Taggart who wrote the two threatening letters? And
left his footprint on the ground under the shed
floor?”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” Phil told him. “He confessed that
he wrote the one to Penny <em>after</em> she fell down the
well. And he also confessed that he was our night
prowler. Actually he did a lot of prowling we didn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
know about, trying to find out if his anonymous letters
had any effect. The first night he came snooping
around he listened outside the living room window
and heard us joking about digging in the well for
buried treasure. That gave him the idea of keeping us
busy digging outside, instead of searching around inside.”</p>

<p>“I can guess what he did next,” Marjorie said with
a rueful laugh. “He wrote that note on an old piece
of paper, put one half in the bottle Judy and I found
down on the beach, and the other half in the pocket
of the old suit Brook found when the boys were out
camping.” She stopped suddenly, her blue eyes wide
with amazement. “But how and when did he manage
to put that map in the lid of the costume jewelry
box?”</p>

<p>“I can answer that one,” Penny said with a sigh.
“The day our first guests arrived, I heard someone
rummaging around in the storage room. I thought it
was you, Marjorie, and thought you were fibbing
later when you insisted you were out in the Donahues’
cabin helping Ann Mary count their laundry.” She
laughed. “I owe you an apology, honey. While you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
and Ann Mary were busy, and Phil and I were upstairs
hanging curtains, Taggart must have sneaked
into the storage room and pasted that map behind the
rotten lining of the old jewelry box.”</p>

<p>“You’re both two jumps ahead of me,” Philip said,
laughing. “Taggart did put the map where you found
it, but first he had to have some excuse for coming out
here. He heard in the village that we were looking
for someone who would take the soiled linen in to the
laundry-mat and applied to Penny for the job.”</p>

<p>Penny moaned, covering her pretty face with both
hands. “Oh, why did I fall into his trap so easily? I
should have guessed when he offered to do it so
cheaply, that something was wrong.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” Peter said protectively. “Taggart did
handle the laundry situation in a very satisfactory
manner, so I don’t think anyone can blame you for
not suspecting him of an ulterior motive.”</p>

<p>Phil nodded. “That’s right, Penny, nobody blames
you. The trouble was that no one paid much attention
to him when he came out here. I imagine Ann Mary
didn’t always have the bundle ready, or his pay when
he brought out the clean wash. Once when she left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
him alone in the kitchen he slipped down to the
beach and stuck the bottle containing half the note
under a rock.”</p>

<p>“We made everything so easy for him,” Marjorie
groaned. “He was there in the kitchen, I remember,
the day Ann Mary suggested that Judy and I search
for rare shells. He was also there the time I asked her
if it would be all right for us to spend the first rainy
day rummaging through the old trunks in the storage
room.”</p>

<p>“And,” Penny added, “he knew exactly when the
boys left on their camping trip. Remember? Ann
Mary told him he had to bring back their clean shirts
before they left. I imagine it was simple for him to
find out from her where they were going.”</p>

<p>“Uh huh,” Phil said. “<em>Very</em> simple. Ann Mary had
no reason to suspect him. He followed them to Uncle
John’s fishing camp only to find that they had moved
deeper into the woods. He saw the Bronc’s tire tracks
and followed them to the lake. Early in the morning
before Brook’s adventure, he rigged up the coat with
the other half of the note in the pocket. He could
count on the fact that one of the boys, while out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
canoeing, would be sure to notice what looked like
the torso of a human body.” Phil smiled. “Taggart
also knew that Jimmy, like Marjorie, was sure treasure
was buried around here and was looking for clues.”</p>

<p>“And,” Peter added, “the man knew that no boy
could resist going through the pockets of an old coat
he found.”</p>

<p>Jimmy’s tanned cheeks were very red. “Well,” he
said, “that clears up all the mysterious clues and letters.
And we certainly all played right into his hands
when we issued invitations to the masquerade.”</p>

<p>“And,” Penny added, “when I dropped hints all
over the village that we were going to show our
guests the secret room that night.” She sighed. “What
I don’t understand is how Taggart knew there was a
secret drawer in the safe.”</p>

<p>“Because,” Philip explained, staring at Marjorie,
“one day when he was out here he caught a glimpse
of the safe. Not only is he a notorious forger, but,
in between sessions in jail, he’s made an exhaustive
study of safes. He knew that the particular style and
make of the one in the secret room had a hidden
drawer in the top. Since we obviously hadn’t found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
the certificates while we were cleaning up the Lodge,
he guessed that they might be in the secret compartment
of the safe.”</p>

<p>“But,” Jimmy interrupted. “When on earth did he
get a glimpse of the safe? Up until tonight&mdash;I mean
last night&mdash;nobody but you and Pat ever went into
the secret room. And I’m sure neither of you was
careless enough to open the door unless you were
sure no one was lurking around.”</p>

<p>It was now Marjorie’s turn to cover her red cheeks
with both hands. “I can answer that one,” she confessed
miserably. “One day when Mr. Taggart was
here, I showed Judy how the door opened. He must
have been hiding in the alcove when the bookshelves
moved back. I heard someone moving down the hall
just before we left, and thought it was Ann Mary
with a bundle of soiled laundry. But I guess there’s
no doubt that it was Mr. Taggart.” She raised her
face, on the verge of tears. “Thinking back, I remember
now that he was in the kitchen, and Judy and I
had just left there when she begged me to show her
how the secret door worked. Oh,” she finished, “how
can I be so dumb?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
“’Tain’t easy,” Jimmy said, grinning. “You’ve got
to have a lot of practice before you can be as hopeless
as you are!”</p>

<p>“Never mind, honey,” Penny said to Marjorie in a
comforting voice. “After all, in a way you helped to
set the trap that caught Mr. X.” She turned to Philip.
“We’re all trying to tell your story for you, and I,
for one, am getting confused. Once Taggart got a
glimpse of the safe and knew how to get into the
secret room, why did he wait until the masquerade to
go in there?”</p>

<p>Phil chuckled. “Because he didn’t know the combination
of the safe. He could, of course, have sneaked
out here at night after we’d all gone to bed and used
dynamite to open the safe, but that would have been
pretty risky. Soon after he saw the safe and the room,
we issued blanket invitations to the masquerade and
you slyly hinted that part of the evening’s entertainment
would be a visit to the secret room. Taggart
promptly decided that the safest way of getting what
he wanted was to let us lead him right to it.”</p>

<p>“In other words,” Peter added, “while we were
setting our little trap, Mr. X was setting one of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
own. While his gangster friends were holding up the
rest of the party, he planned to force one of you
Allens to accompany him into the secret room and
open the safe.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” Philip said. “And I made things
easy for him when I asked him to lend atmosphere
by posing by the safe; and then, to cap the climax,
I stayed behind after everyone else had left. The only
thing I can say for myself,” he finished, “is that I did
have the presence of mind to close the door as soon
as I realized I’d walked into the trap we had set for
him. And even that,” he admitted, “was sort of a
reflex action.”</p>

<p>“Call it what you like,” Jimmy said, “but it was
important. Otherwise, Taggart would have heard the
outraged cries of his gunmen when they walked into
the arms of the police. During that commotion he
might have escaped&mdash;with the real loot.” He leaned
forward to tap Phil’s knee. “Now that we’ve all, with
the exception of the inlaws-to-be, confessed to being
dimwits in one way or another, let’s hear more about
those stock certificates, Phil. Answer me, yes, or no,
are they worth enough so I can get a sailboat?”</p>

HAPPY ENDING</h2>

<p class="noi">“<span class="smcap">I object</span>,” Peter cried. “My wife-to-be isn’t a dimwit.
She’s a heroine.”</p>

<p>“I object, too,” Adra said. “Phil’s a hero.”</p>

<p>“All right, all right,” Jimmy said. “But it’s getting
on toward dawn. Marjorie and I are dimwits. Just
tell me whether or not we’re rich or poor.”</p>

<p>“We’re rich,” Philip said as he drew from his
pocket the bulging envelope he had earlier been
forced to hand over to Taggart. He handed it to
Penny. “Open it, Sis.”</p>

<p>Her hands shaking with excitement, Penny lifted
the flap and pulled out a wad of musty-smelling, yellowed
stock certificates.</p>

<p>“Those ancient documents,” Phil told her quietly,
“don’t look like much. But, according to Taggart’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
confession, when we turn them in we’ll collect about
$50,000&mdash;their cash value plus back dividends and interest.”</p>

<p>For a moment no one spoke. Then Jimmy yelled:
“WHOOPEE! The hidden treasure is found at last.
And boy oh boy, will I ever get the finest sailboat
that was ever launched!”</p>

<p>“I can’t believe it,” Marjorie said in an awed voice.
“Why, I&mdash;I’m an heiress!”</p>

<p>“<em>I</em> can believe it,” Peter said, pretending to be
mournful. “Penny will never marry poor penniless
me now.”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” Penny said with a laugh. “And
now Phil doesn’t have to marry Adra for her money
either.”</p>

<p>Everyone laughed then, almost hysterically. They
were all tired and over-stimulated. Dawn was pinking
the sky in the east.</p>

<p>“If you ask me,” Jimmy said, stretching and yawning,
“I’d say we all ought to catch a little shut-eye.
I for one won’t believe any part of Phil’s yarn until
I hear it all over again in broad daylight.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span></p>

<p>But the next morning, after consulting the older
men who were staying at the Lodge, the Allens
learned that the old stock certificates were worth even
more than Taggart had estimated.</p>

<p>“I know the company well,” Mr. Curtis told Phil.
“Bought stock in it myself a few years ago when it
got a government loan and staged a comeback.”</p>

<p>And then, to the delight of everyone, Adra’s father,
Mr. Prentice, arrived by plane. They were all eager
for the advice of such an experienced businessman.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t sell,” he said, after hearing the whole
story. “You couldn’t invest your money in a safer
concern. When you collect your back dividends
you’ll each have a tidy sum if you need cash now.
If not, I would reinvest that money and thus provide
yourselves with a comfortable yearly income from it
and the original investment.” He smiled at them. “I’ll
handle the whole matter for you, if you like.”</p>

<p>“Please do,” Penny cried. “Oh, it’s all so wonderful!
Peter and I can get married right away and Marjorie
and Jimmy are assured of college educations.”</p>

<p>“What about us?” Philip crossed over to stand beside
Adra who was perched on the arm of her father’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
chair. “Sir,” he said with old-fashioned formality,
“your daughter has done me the honor of promising
to become my wife. With your permission we would
like to be married sometime this fall.”</p>

<p>Marjorie could not suppress a giggle. Phil did look
as though he ought to be wearing a Prince Albert
coat instead of a sports jacket and slacks.</p>

<p>Mr. Prentice stood up to shake hands gravely with
Philip. “You have my permission, sir,” he said, a
smile twitching the corners of his mouth. “And my
blessing.”</p>

<p>Peter grabbed Penny’s hand. “Come on, let’s celebrate!
No more work today for any of the Allens.”</p>

<p>But Phil and Penny could not take a holiday so
soon. Most of the guests were making arrangements
for their departures. Phil and Penny had to be everywhere
at once to help them pack and ship off their
luggage, or to make reservations for them on planes
and buses.</p>

<p>Judy flatly refused to leave with her parents and
Alf. “I’ve just got to stay here for Penny’s wedding,”
she begged. “Marjorie and I are going to be bridesmaids.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
“Then we’ll stay too,” Mrs. Powell said and added
to Penny, “That is, if we’re invited.”</p>

<p>“Of course, you are,” Penny cried. “The Curtises
and Adra and her father are going to stay on for the
great event, so we’ll have one grand houseparty until
then.”</p>

<p>By Labor Day evening all of the other guests had
left the Lodge. To celebrate the first dinner of the
wedding day houseparty, Pat opened a bottle of
champagne that he claimed to have held over from
his wedding for another special occasion.</p>

<p>“Ugh,” Marjorie spluttered after one sip. “What
horrible tasting stuff!”</p>

<p>Jimmy, Judy and Alf heartily agreed with her and
gratefully accepted the ginger ale Ann Mary hastily
substituted for the bubbling wine.</p>

<p>Peter proposed a toast. “Here’s to the Allens of
Allen Lodge. May they always be happy and prosperous!”</p>

<p>“You’d better include the Wylands in that toast,”
Marjorie said with an impish smile. “Penny won’t be
an Allen much longer.”</p>

<p>A few days later, on a beautiful, bright September<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
morning, the wedding took place. Marjorie and Judy
were so excited they couldn’t fasten the zippers on
their crisp organdie frocks. Penny, sweetly serene,
came to the rescue, wearing her lovely flowing gown
of white tulle over taffeta. Marjorie finally conquered
her nervousness long enough to pin on the clusters of
orange blossoms which held Penny’s lace veil in
place.</p>

<p>Then, carrying Pat’s enormous bridal bouquet of
long-stemmed white chrysanthemums, Penny came
from the house on Philip’s arm to join Peter under
the trees.</p>

<p>Marjorie held her breath while Penny and Peter
made their vows in clear, steady voices. After the
ceremony was over, Charles was the first to congratulate
the bridegroom, and Marjorie, the first to kiss
her sister.</p>

<p>“You didn’t act scared at all,” she whispered. “I
know I would have said I <em>don’t</em> instead of I do, just
because I was so nervous.” She turned to give Peter a
hug. “It’s so nice to have another brother,” she cried.
“And to know that soon I’ll have another sister.”</p>

<p>A merry wedding breakfast was served on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
sunny porch and this time it was Marjorie who proposed
a toast. “To Allen Lodge,” she cried, holding
her punch glass high, “where there’s never a dull
moment. Here’s hoping that it holds some new adventure
just waiting to be discovered.”</p>

<p>“I’m with you there, Sis,” cried Jimmy.</p>

<p>But Peter and Penny only smiled happily.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
